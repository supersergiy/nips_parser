2017,Wider and Deeper; Cheaper and Faster: Tensorized LSTMs for Sequence Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6606-wider-and-deeper-cheaper-and-faster-tensorized-lstms-for-sequence-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6606-wider-and-deeper-cheaper-and-faster-tensorized-lstms-for-sequence-learning,Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a popular approach to boosting the ability of Recurrent Neural Networks to store longer term temporal information. The capacity of an LSTM network can be increased by widening and adding layers. However; usually the former introduces additional parameters; while the latter increases the runtime. As an alternative we propose the Tensorized LSTM in which the hidden states are represented by tensors and updated via a cross-layer convolution. By increasing the tensor size; the network can be widened efficiently without additional parameters since the parameters are shared across different locations in the tensor; by delaying the output; the network can be deepened implicitly with little additional runtime since deep computations for each timestep are merged into temporal computations of the sequence. Experiments conducted on five challenging sequence learning tasks show the potential of the proposed model.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6606-wider-and-deeper-cheaper-and-faster-tensorized-lstms-for-sequence-learning/bibtex,Zhen He; Shaobing Gao; Liang Xiao; Daxue Liu; Hangen He; David Barber
2017,Breaking the Nonsmooth Barrier: A Scalable Parallel Method for Composite Optimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6611-breaking-the-nonsmooth-barrier-a-scalable-parallel-method-for-composite-optimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6611-breaking-the-nonsmooth-barrier-a-scalable-parallel-method-for-composite-optimization,Due to their simplicity and excellent performance; parallel asynchronous variants of stochastic gradient descent have become popular methods to solve a wide range of large-scale optimization problems on multi-core architectures. Yet; despite their practical success; support for nonsmooth objectives is still lacking; making them unsuitable for many problems of interest in machine learning; such as the Lasso; group Lasso or empirical risk minimization with convex constraints.   In this work; we propose and analyze ProxASAGA; a fully asynchronous sparse method inspired by SAGA; a variance reduced incremental gradient algorithm. The proposed method is easy to implement and significantly outperforms the state of the art on several nonsmooth; large-scale problems. We prove that our method achieves a theoretical linear speedup with respect to the sequential version under assumptions on the sparsity of gradients and block-separability of the proximal term. Empirical benchmarks on a multi-core architecture illustrate practical speedups of up to 12x on a 20-core machine.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6611-breaking-the-nonsmooth-barrier-a-scalable-parallel-method-for-composite-optimization/bibtex,Fabian Pedregosa; R?mi Leblond; Simon Lacoste-Julien
2017,Scalable Generalized Linear Bandits: Online Computation and Hashing,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6615-scalable-generalized-linear-bandits-online-computation-and-hashing.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6615-scalable-generalized-linear-bandits-online-computation-and-hashing,Generalized Linear Bandits (GLBs); a natural extension of the stochastic linear bandits; has been popular and successful in recent years.  However; existing GLBs scale poorly with the number of rounds and the number of arms; limiting their utility in practice.  This paper proposes new; scalable solutions to the GLB problem in two respects.  First; unlike existing GLBs; whose per-time-step space and time complexity grow at least linearly with time $t$; we propose a new algorithm that performs online computations to enjoy a constant space and time complexity.  At its heart is a novel Generalized Linear extension of the Online-to-confidence-set Conversion (GLOC method) that takes \emph{any} online learning algorithm and turns it into a GLB algorithm.  As a special case; we apply GLOC to the online Newton step algorithm; which results in a low-regret GLB algorithm with much lower time and memory complexity than prior work.  Second; for the case where the number $N$ of arms is very large; we propose new algorithms in which each next arm is selected via an inner product search.  Such methods can be implemented via hashing algorithms (i.e.; ``hash-amenable'') and result in a time complexity sublinear in $N$.  While a Thompson sampling extension of GLOC is hash-amenable; its regret bound for $d$-dimensional arm sets scales with $d^{3/2}$; whereas GLOC's regret bound scales with $d$.  Towards closing this gap; we propose a new hash-amenable algorithm whose regret bound scales with $d^{5/4}$.  Finally; we propose a fast approximate hash-key computation (inner product) with a better accuracy than the state-of-the-art; which can be of independent interest.  We conclude the paper with preliminary experimental results confirming the merits of our methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6615-scalable-generalized-linear-bandits-online-computation-and-hashing/bibtex,Kwang-Sung Jun; Aniruddha Bhargava; Robert Nowak; Rebecca Willett
2017,Machine Learning with Adversaries: Byzantine Tolerant Gradient Descent,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6617-machine-learning-with-adversaries-byzantine-tolerant-gradient-descent.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6617-machine-learning-with-adversaries-byzantine-tolerant-gradient-descent,We study the resilience  to Byzantine failures of distributed implementations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). So far; distributed machine learning frameworks have largely ignored the possibility of failures; especially  arbitrary (i.e.; Byzantine) ones. Causes of failures include software bugs; network asynchrony; biases in local datasets; as well as attackers trying to compromise the entire system. Assuming a set of $n$ workers; up to $f$  being Byzantine;  we ask how resilient  can SGD be; without limiting the dimension; nor the size of the parameter space. We first show that no gradient aggregation rule based on a linear combination of the vectors proposed by the workers (i.e; current approaches) tolerates a single Byzantine failure. We then formulate a resilience  property of the aggregation rule capturing the basic requirements to guarantee convergence despite $f$   Byzantine workers. We propose \emph{Krum}; an aggregation rule that satisfies our resilience  property; which we argue is the first provably Byzantine-resilient algorithm for distributed SGD. We also report on experimental evaluations of Krum.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6617-machine-learning-with-adversaries-byzantine-tolerant-gradient-descent/bibtex,Peva Blanchard; El Mahdi El Mhamdi; Rachid Guerraoui; Julien Stainer
2017,On the Consistency of Quick Shift,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6610-on-the-consistency-of-quick-shift.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6610-on-the-consistency-of-quick-shift,Quick Shift is a popular mode-seeking and clustering algorithm. We present finite sample statistical consistency guarantees for Quick Shift on mode and cluster recovery under mild distributional assumptions. We then apply our results to construct a consistent modal regression algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6610-on-the-consistency-of-quick-shift/bibtex,Heinrich Jiang
2017,Deep Subspace Clustering Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6608-deep-subspace-clustering-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6608-deep-subspace-clustering-networks,We present a novel deep neural network architecture for unsupervised subspace clustering. This architecture is built upon deep auto-encoders; which non-linearly map the input data into a latent space. Our key idea is to introduce a novel self-expressive layer between the encoder and the decoder to mimic the "self-expressiveness" property that has proven effective in traditional subspace clustering. Being differentiable; our new self-expressive layer provides a simple but effective way to learn pairwise affinities between all data points through a standard back-propagation procedure. Being nonlinear; our neural-network based method is able to cluster data points having complex (often nonlinear) structures. We further propose pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that let us effectively learn the parameters of our subspace clustering networks. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised subspace clustering methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6608-deep-subspace-clustering-networks/bibtex,Pan Ji; Tong Zhang; Hongdong Li; Mathieu Salzmann; Ian Reid
2017,Hunt For The Unique; Stable; Sparse And Fast Feature Learning On Graphs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6614-hunt-for-the-unique-stable-sparse-and-fast-feature-learning-on-graphs.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6614-hunt-for-the-unique-stable-sparse-and-fast-feature-learning-on-graphs,For the purpose of learning on graphs; we hunt for a graph feature representation that exhibit certain uniqueness; stability and sparsity properties while also being amenable to fast computation. This leads to the discovery of family of graph spectral distances (denoted as FGSD) and their based graph feature representations; which we prove to possess most of these desired properties. To both evaluate the quality of graph features produced by FGSD and demonstrate their utility; we apply them to the graph classification problem. Through extensive experiments; we show that a simple SVM based classification algorithm; driven with our powerful FGSD based graph features; significantly outperforms all the more sophisticated state-of-art algorithms on the unlabeled node datasets in terms of both accuracy and speed; it also yields very competitive results on the labeled datasets - despite the fact it does not utilize any node label information.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6614-hunt-for-the-unique-stable-sparse-and-fast-feature-learning-on-graphs/bibtex,Saurabh Verma; Zhi-Li Zhang
2017,Probabilistic Models for Integration Error in the Assessment of Functional Cardiac Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6616-probabilistic-models-for-integration-error-in-the-assessment-of-functional-cardiac-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6616-probabilistic-models-for-integration-error-in-the-assessment-of-functional-cardiac-models,This paper studies the numerical computation of integrals; representing estimates or predictions; over the output $f(x)$ of a computational model with respect to a distribution $p(\mathrm{d}x)$ over uncertain inputs $x$ to the model. For the functional cardiac models that motivate this work; neither $f$ nor $p$ possess a closed-form expression and evaluation of either requires $\approx$ 100 CPU hours; precluding standard numerical integration methods. Our proposal is to treat integration as an estimation problem; with a joint model for both the a priori unknown function $f$ and the a priori unknown distribution $p$. The result is a posterior distribution over the integral that explicitly accounts for dual sources of numerical approximation error due to a severely limited computational budget. This construction is applied to account; in a statistically principled manner; for the impact of numerical errors that (at present) are confounding factors in functional cardiac model assessment.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6616-probabilistic-models-for-integration-error-in-the-assessment-of-functional-cardiac-models/bibtex,Chris Oates; Steven Niederer; Angela Lee; Fran?ois-Xavier Briol; Mark Girolami
2017,Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6613-dilated-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6613-dilated-recurrent-neural-networks,Learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on long sequences is a notoriously difficult task.  There are three major challenges: 1) complex dependencies; 2) vanishing and exploding gradients; and 3) efficient parallelization. In this paper; we introduce a simple yet effective RNN connection structure; the DilatedRNN; which simultaneously tackles all of these challenges.  The proposed architecture is characterized by multi-resolution dilated recurrent skip connections and can be combined flexibly with diverse RNN cells.  Moreover; the DilatedRNN reduces the number of parameters needed and enhances training efficiency significantly; while matching state-of-the-art performance (even with standard RNN cells) in tasks involving very long-term dependencies.  To provide a theory-based quantification of the architecture's advantages; we introduce a memory capacity measure; the mean recurrent length; which is more suitable for RNNs with long skip connections than existing measures.  We rigorously prove the advantages of the DilatedRNN over other recurrent neural architectures.  The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/code-terminator/DilatedRNN.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6613-dilated-recurrent-neural-networks/bibtex,Shiyu Chang; Yang Zhang; Wei Han; Mo Yu; Xiaoxiao Guo; Wei Tan; Xiaodong Cui; Michael Witbrock; Mark A.

2017,Dual-Agent GANs for Photorealistic and Identity Preserving Profile Face Synthesis,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6612-dual-agent-gans-for-photorealistic-and-identity-preserving-profile-face-synthesis.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6612-dual-agent-gans-for-photorealistic-and-identity-preserving-profile-face-synthesis,Synthesizing realistic profile faces is promising for more efficiently  training deep pose-invariant models for large-scale unconstrained face recognition; by populating samples with extreme poses and avoiding tedious annotations. However; learning from synthetic faces may not achieve the desired performance due to the discrepancy between distributions of the synthetic and real face images. To narrow this gap; we propose a Dual-Agent Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN) model; which can improve the realism of a face simulator's output using unlabeled real faces; while preserving the identity information during the realism refinement. The dual agents are specifically designed for distinguishing real v.s. fake and identities simultaneously. In particular; we employ an off-the-shelf 3D face model as a simulator to generate profile face images with varying poses. DA-GAN leverages a fully convolutional network as the generator to generate high-resolution images and an auto-encoder as the discriminator with the dual agents. Besides the novel architecture; we make several key modifications to the standard GAN to preserve pose and texture; preserve identity and stabilize training process: (i) a pose perception loss; (ii) an identity perception loss; (iii) an adversarial loss with a boundary equilibrium regularization term. Experimental results show that DA-GAN not only presents compelling perceptual results but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts on the large-scale and challenging NIST IJB-A unconstrained face recognition benchmark. In addition; the proposed DA-GAN is also promising as a new approach for solving generic transfer learning problems more effectively.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6612-dual-agent-gans-for-photorealistic-and-identity-preserving-profile-face-synthesis/bibtex,Jian Zhao; Lin Xiong; Panasonic Karlekar Jayashree; Jianshu Li; Fang Zhao; Zhecan Wang; Panasonic Sugiri Pranata; Panasonic Shengmei Shen; Shuicheng Yan; Jiashi Feng
2017,Concentration of Multilinear Functions of the Ising Model with Applications to Network Data,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6607-concentration-of-multilinear-functions-of-the-ising-model-with-applications-to-network-data.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6607-concentration-of-multilinear-functions-of-the-ising-model-with-applications-to-network-data,We prove near-tight concentration of measure for polynomial functions of the Ising model; under high temperature; improving the radius of concentration guaranteed by known results by polynomial factors in the dimension (i.e.~the number of nodes in the Ising model). We show that our results are optimal up to logarithmic factors in the dimension. We obtain our results by extending and strengthening the exchangeable-pairs approach used to prove concentration of measure in this setting by Chatterjee. We demonstrate the efficacy of such functions as statistics for testing the strength  of interactions in social networks in both synthetic and real world data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6607-concentration-of-multilinear-functions-of-the-ising-model-with-applications-to-network-data/bibtex,Constantinos Daskalakis; Nishanth Dikkala; Gautam Kamath
2017,Attentional Pooling for Action Recognition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6609-attentional-pooling-for-action-recognition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6609-attentional-pooling-for-action-recognition,We introduce a simple yet surprisingly powerful model to incorporate attention in action recognition and human object interaction tasks. Our proposed attention module can be trained with or without extra supervision; and gives a sizable boost in accuracy while keeping the network size and computational cost nearly the same. It leads to significant improvements over state of the art base architecture on three standard action recognition benchmarks across still images and videos; and establishes new state of the art on MPII dataset with 12.5% relative improvement. We also perform an extensive analysis of our attention module both empirically and analytically. In terms of the latter; we introduce a novel derivation of bottom-up and top-down attention as low-rank approximations of bilinear pooling methods (typically used for fine-grained classification). From this perspective; our attention formulation suggests a novel characterization of action recognition as a fine-grained recognition problem.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6609-attentional-pooling-for-action-recognition/bibtex,Rohit Girdhar; Deva Ramanan
2017,Cortical microcircuits as gated-recurrent neural networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6631-cortical-microcircuits-as-gated-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6631-cortical-microcircuits-as-gated-recurrent-neural-networks,Cortical circuits exhibit intricate recurrent architectures that are remarkably similar across different brain areas. Such stereotyped structure suggests the existence of common computational principles. However; such principles have remained largely elusive. Inspired by gated-memory networks; namely long short-term memory networks (LSTMs); we introduce a recurrent neural network in which information is gated through inhibitory cells that are subtractive (subLSTM).  We propose a natural mapping of subLSTMs onto known canonical excitatory-inhibitory cortical microcircuits.   Our empirical evaluation across sequential image classification and language modelling tasks shows that subLSTM units can achieve similar performance to LSTM units. These results suggest that cortical circuits can be optimised to solve complex contextual problems and proposes a novel view on their computational function. Overall our work provides a step towards unifying recurrent networks as used in machine learning with their biological counterparts.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6631-cortical-microcircuits-as-gated-recurrent-neural-networks/bibtex,Rui Costa; Ioannis Alexandros Assael; Brendan Shillingford; Nando de Freitas; TIm Vogels
2017,A Linear-Time Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Test,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6630-a-linear-time-kernel-goodness-of-fit-test.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6630-a-linear-time-kernel-goodness-of-fit-test,We propose a novel adaptive test of goodness-of-fit; with computational cost linear in the number of samples. We learn the test features that best indicate the differences between observed samples and a reference model; by minimizing the false negative rate. These features are constructed via Stein's method; meaning that it is not necessary to compute the normalising constant of the model. We analyse the asymptotic Bahadur efficiency of the new test; and prove that under a mean-shift alternative; our test always has greater relative efficiency than a previous linear-time kernel test; regardless of the choice of parameters for that test. In experiments; the performance of our method exceeds that of the earlier linear-time test; and matches or exceeds the power of a quadratic-time kernel test. In high dimensions and where model structure may be exploited; our goodness of fit test performs far better than a quadratic-time two-sample test based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy; with samples drawn from the model.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6630-a-linear-time-kernel-goodness-of-fit-test/bibtex,Wittawat Jitkrittum; Wenkai Xu; Zoltan Szabo; Kenji Fukumizu; Arthur Gretton
2017,Structured Embedding Models for Grouped Data,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6629-structured-embedding-models-for-grouped-data.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6629-structured-embedding-models-for-grouped-data,Word embeddings are a powerful approach for analyzing language; and exponential family embeddings (EFE) extend them to other types of data. Here we develop structured exponential family embeddings (S-EFE); a method for discovering embeddings that vary across related groups of data. We study how the word usage of U.S. Congressional speeches varies across states and party affiliation; how words are used differently across sections of the ArXiv; and how the co-purchase patterns of groceries can vary across seasons. Key to the success of our method is that the groups share statistical information. We develop two sharing strategies: hierarchical modeling and amortization. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in empirical studies of speeches; abstracts; and shopping baskets. We show how SEFE enables group-specific interpretation of word usage; and outperforms EFE in predicting held-out data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6629-structured-embedding-models-for-grouped-data/bibtex,Maja Rudolph; Francisco Ruiz; Susan Athey; David Blei
2017,ELF: An Extensive; Lightweight and Flexible Research Platform for Real-time Strategy Games,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6859-elf-an-extensive-lightweight-and-flexible-research-platform-for-real-time-strategy-games.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6859-elf-an-extensive-lightweight-and-flexible-research-platform-for-real-time-strategy-games,In this paper; we propose ELF; an Extensive; Lightweight and Flexible platform for fundamental reinforcement learning research. Using ELF; we implement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game environments (Mini-RTS; Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS; as a miniature version of StarCraft; captures key game dynamics and runs at 165K frame-per-second (FPS) on a laptop. When coupled with modern reinforcement learning methods; the system can train a full-game bot against built-in AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition; our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication topologies; choices of RL methods; changes in game parameters; and can host existing C/C++-based game environments like ALE. Using ELF; we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with Leaky ReLU and Batch Normalization coupled with long-horizon training and progressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than 70% of the time in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the other two games. In game replays; we show our agents learn interesting strategies.

2017,Modulating early visual processing by language,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7237-modulating-early-visual-processing-by-language.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7237-modulating-early-visual-processing-by-language,It is commonly assumed that language refers to high-level visual concepts while leaving low-level visual processing unaffected. This view dominates the current literature in computational models for language-vision tasks; where visual and linguistic inputs are mostly processed independently before being fused into a single representation. In this paper; we deviate from this classic pipeline and propose to modulate the \emph{entire visual processing} by a linguistic input. Specifically; we introduce Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN) as an efficient mechanism to modulate convolutional feature maps by a linguistic embedding. We apply CBN to a pre-trained Residual Network (ResNet); leading to the MODulatEd ResNet (\MRN) architecture; and show that this significantly improves strong baselines on two visual question answering tasks. Our ablation study confirms that modulating from the early stages of the visual processing is beneficial.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7237-modulating-early-visual-processing-by-language/bibtex,Harm de Vries; Florian Strub; Jeremie Mary; Hugo Larochelle; Olivier Pietquin; Aaron C.

2017,On Frank-Wolfe and Equilibrium Computation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7236-on-frank-wolfe-and-equilibrium-computation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7236-on-frank-wolfe-and-equilibrium-computation,We consider the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method for constrained convex optimization; and we show that this classical technique can be interpreted from a different perspective: FW emerges as the computation of an equilibrium (saddle point) of a special convex-concave zero sum game. This saddle-point trick relies on the existence of no-regret online learning to both generate a sequence of iterates but also to provide a proof of convergence through vanishing regret. We show that our stated equivalence has several nice properties; as it exhibits a modularity that gives rise to various old and new algorithms. We explore a few such resulting methods; and provide experimental results to demonstrate correctness and efficiency.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7236-on-frank-wolfe-and-equilibrium-computation/bibtex,Jacob D.

2016,Optimal spectral transportation with application to music transcription,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6479-optimal-spectral-transportation-with-application-to-music-transcription.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6479-optimal-spectral-transportation-with-application-to-music-transcription,Many spectral unmixing methods rely on the non-negative decomposition of spectral data onto a dictionary of spectral templates. In particular; state-of-the-art music transcription systems decompose the spectrogram of the input signal onto a dictionary of representative note spectra. The typical measures of fit used to quantify the adequacy of the decomposition compare the data and template entries frequency-wise. As such; small displacements of energy from a frequency bin to another as well as variations of timber can disproportionally harm the fit. We address these issues by means of optimal transportation and propose a new measure of fit that treats the frequency distributions of energy holistically as opposed to frequency-wise. Building on the harmonic nature of sound; the new measure is invariant to shifts of energy to harmonically-related frequencies; as well as to small and local displacements of energy. Equipped with this new measure of fit; the dictionary of note templates can be considerably simplified to a set of Dirac vectors located at the target fundamental frequencies (musical pitch values). This in turns gives ground to a very fast and simple decomposition algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on real musical data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6479-optimal-spectral-transportation-with-application-to-music-transcription/bibtex,R?mi Flamary; C?dric F?votte; Nicolas Courty; Valentin Emiya

As calcium imaging datasets grow in size; automated detection of individual neurons is becoming important. Here we apply a supervised learning approach to this problem and show that convolutional networks can achieve near-human accuracy and superhuman speed. Accuracy is superior to the popular PCA/ICA method based on precision and recall relative to ground truth annotation by a human expert. These results suggest that convolutional networks are an efficient and flexible tool for the analysis of large-scale calcium imaging data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6138-automatic-neuron-detection-in-calcium-imaging-data-using-convolutional-networks/bibtex,Noah Apthorpe; Alexander Riordan; Robert Aguilar; Jan Homann; Yi Gu; David Tank; H.

2016,Flexible Models for Microclustering with Application to Entity Resolution,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6334-flexible-models-for-microclustering-with-application-to-entity-resolution.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6334-flexible-models-for-microclustering-with-application-to-entity-resolution,Most generative models for clustering implicitly assume that the number of data points in each cluster grows linearly with the total number of data points. Finite mixture models; Dirichlet process mixture models; and Pitman--Yor process mixture models make this assumption; as do all other infinitely exchangeable clustering models. However; for some applications; this assumption is inappropriate. For example; when performing entity resolution; the size of each cluster should be unrelated to the size of the data set; and each cluster should contain a negligible fraction of the total number of data points. These applications require models that yield clusters whose sizes grow sublinearly with the size of the data set. We address this requirement by defining the microclustering property and introducing a new class of models that can exhibit this property. We compare models within this class to two commonly used clustering models using four entity-resolution data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6334-flexible-models-for-microclustering-with-application-to-entity-resolution/bibtex,Brenda Betancourt; Giacomo Zanella; Jeffrey W.

2016,A Probabilistic Model of Social Decision Making based on Reward Maximization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6537-a-probabilistic-model-of-social-decision-making-based-on-reward-maximization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6537-a-probabilistic-model-of-social-decision-making-based-on-reward-maximization,A fundamental problem in cognitive neuroscience is how humans make decisions; act; and behave in relation to other humans. Here we adopt the hypothesis that when we are in an interactive social setting; our brains perform Bayesian inference of the intentions and cooperativeness of others using probabilistic representations. We employ the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to model human decision making in a social context; focusing specifically on the volunteer's dilemma in a version of the classic Public Goods Game. We show that the POMDP model explains both the behavior of subjects as well as neural activity recorded using fMRI during the game. The decisions of subjects can be modeled across all trials using two interpretable parameters. Furthermore; the expected reward predicted by the model for each subject was correlated with the activation of brain areas related to reward expectation in social interactions. Our results suggest a probabilistic basis for human social decision making within the framework of expected reward maximization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6537-a-probabilistic-model-of-social-decision-making-based-on-reward-maximization/bibtex,Koosha Khalvati; Seongmin A.

2016,Learning Additive Exponential Family Graphical Models via \ell_{2;1}-norm Regularized M-Estimation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6106-learning-additive-exponential-family-graphical-models-via-ell_21-norm-regularized-m-estimation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6106-learning-additive-exponential-family-graphical-models-via-ell_21-norm-regularized-m-estimation,We investigate a subclass of exponential family graphical models of which the sufficient statistics are defined by arbitrary additive forms. We propose two $\ell_{2;1}$-norm regularized maximum likelihood estimators to learn the model parameters from i.i.d. samples. The first one is a joint MLE estimator which estimates all the parameters simultaneously. The second one is a node-wise conditional MLE estimator which estimates the parameters for each node individually. For both estimators; statistical analysis shows that under mild conditions the extra flexibility gained by the additive exponential family models comes at almost no cost of statistical efficiency.

2016,Coevolutionary Latent Feature Processes for Continuous-Time User-Item Interactions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6480-coevolutionary-latent-feature-processes-for-continuous-time-user-item-interactions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6480-coevolutionary-latent-feature-processes-for-continuous-time-user-item-interactions,Matching users to the right items at the right time is a fundamental task in recommendation systems. As users interact with different items over time; users' and items' feature may evolve and co-evolve over time. Traditional models based on static latent features or discretizing time into epochs can become ineffective for capturing the fine-grained temporal dynamics in the user-item interactions. We propose a coevolutionary latent feature process model that accurately captures the coevolving nature of users' and items' feature. To learn parameters; we design an efficient convex optimization algorithm with a novel low rank space sharing constraints. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in user behavior prediction compared to state-of-the-arts.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6480-coevolutionary-latent-feature-processes-for-continuous-time-user-item-interactions/bibtex,Yichen Wang; Nan Du; Rakshit Trivedi; Le Song
2016,Computing and maximizing influence in linear threshold and triggering models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6347-computing-and-maximizing-influence-in-linear-threshold-and-triggering-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6347-computing-and-maximizing-influence-in-linear-threshold-and-triggering-models,We establish upper and lower bounds for the influence of a set of nodes in certain types of contagion models. We derive two sets of bounds; the first designed for linear threshold models; and the second more broadly applicable to a general class of triggering models; which subsumes the popular independent cascade models; as well. We quantify the gap between our upper and lower bounds in the case of the linear threshold model and illustrate the gains of our upper bounds for independent cascade models in relation to existing results. Importantly; our lower bounds are monotonic and submodular; implying that a greedy algorithm for influence maximization is guaranteed to produce a maximizer within a (1 - 1/e)-factor of the truth. Although the problem of exact influence computation is NP-hard in general; our bounds may be evaluated efficiently. This leads to an attractive; highly scalable algorithm for influence maximization with rigorous theoretical guarantees.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6347-computing-and-maximizing-influence-in-linear-threshold-and-triggering-models/bibtex,Justin T.

2016,Learning in Games: Robustness of Fast Convergence,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6133-learning-in-games-robustness-of-fast-convergence.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6133-learning-in-games-robustness-of-fast-convergence,We show that learning algorithms satisfying a low approximate regret property experience fast convergence to approximate optimality in a large class of repeated games. Our property; which simply requires that each learner has small regret compared to a (1+eps)-multiplicative approximation to the best action in hindsight; is ubiquitous among learning algorithms; it is satisfied even by the vanilla Hedge forecaster. Our results improve upon recent work of Syrgkanis et al. in a number of ways. We require only that players observe payoffs under other players' realized actions; as opposed to expected payoffs. We further show that convergence occurs with high probability; and show convergence under bandit feedback. Finally; we improve upon the speed of convergence by a factor of n; the number of players. Both the scope of settings and the class of algorithms for which our analysis provides fast convergence are considerably broader than in previous work. Our framework applies to dynamic population games via a low approximate regret property for shifting experts. Here we strengthen the results of Lykouris et al. in two ways: We allow players to select learning algorithms from a larger class; which includes a minor variant of the basic Hedge algorithm; and we increase the maximum churn in players for which approximate optimality is achieved. In the bandit setting we present a new algorithm which provides a "small loss"-type bound with improved dependence on the number of actions in utility settings; and is both simple and efficient. This result may be of independent interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6133-learning-in-games-robustness-of-fast-convergence/bibtex,Dylan J.

2016,Disease Trajectory Maps,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6177-disease-trajectory-maps.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6177-disease-trajectory-maps,Medical researchers are coming to appreciate that many diseases are in fact complex; heterogeneous syndromes composed of subpopulations that express different variants of a related complication. Longitudinal data extracted from individual electronic health records (EHR) offer an exciting new way to study subtle differences in the way these diseases progress over time. In this paper; we focus on answering two questions that can be asked using these databases of longitudinal EHR data. First; we want to understand whether there are individuals with similar disease trajectories and whether there are a small number of degrees of freedom that account for differences in trajectories across the population. Second; we want to understand how important clinical outcomes are associated with disease trajectories. To answer these questions; we propose the Disease Trajectory Map (DTM); a novel probabilistic model that learns low-dimensional representations of sparse and irregularly sampled longitudinal data. We propose a stochastic variational inference algorithm for learning the DTM that allows the model to scale to large modern medical datasets. To demonstrate the DTM; we analyze data collected on patients with the complex autoimmune disease; scleroderma. We find that DTM learns meaningful representations of disease trajectories and that the representations are significantly associated with important clinical outcomes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6177-disease-trajectory-maps/bibtex,Peter Schulam; Raman Arora

The dynamic programming framework is employed to balance the high present reward and large penalty on low future outcome in the presence of extensive uncertainties. In particular; we establish theoretical foundations of optimal campaigning over social networks where the user activities are modeled as a multivariate Hawkes process; and we derive a time dependent linear relation between the intensity of exogenous events and several commonly used objective functions of campaigning. We further develop a convex dynamic programming framework for determining the optimal intervention policy that prescribes the required level of external drive at each stage for the desired campaigning result. Experiments on both synthetic data and the real-world MemeTracker dataset show that our algorithm can steer the user activities for optimal campaigning much more accurately than baselines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6102-multistage-campaigning-in-social-networks/bibtex,Mehrdad Farajtabar; Xiaojing Ye; Sahar Harati; Le Song; Hongyuan Zha

Our model is evaluated on a real-world robotic manipulation task that requires displacing objects to target locations by poking. The robot gathered over 400 hours of experience by executing more than 50K pokes on different objects. We propose a novel approach based on deep neural networks for modeling the dynamics of robot's interactions directly from images; by jointly estimating forward and inverse models of dynamics. The inverse model objective provides supervision to construct informative visual features; which the forward model can then predict and in turn regularize the feature space for the inverse model. The interplay between these two objectives creates useful; accurate models that can then be used for multi-step decision making. This formulation has the additional benefit that it is possible to learn forward models in an abstract feature space and thus alleviate the need of predicting pixels. Our experiments show that this joint modeling approach outperforms alternative methods. We also demonstrate that active data collection using the learned model further improves performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6113-learning-to-poke-by-poking-experiential-learning-of-intuitive-physics/bibtex,Pulkit Agrawal; Ashvin V.

Towards this goal; we propose a clustering based regularization that encourages parsimonious representations. Our k-means style objective is easy to optimize and flexible  supporting various forms of clustering; including sample and spatial clustering as well as co-clustering.

2016,An Online Sequence-to-Sequence Model Using Partial Conditioning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6594-an-online-sequence-to-sequence-model-using-partial-conditioning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6594-an-online-sequence-to-sequence-model-using-partial-conditioning,Sequence-to-sequence models have achieved impressive results on various tasks. However; they are unsuitable for tasks that require incremental predictions to be made as more data arrives or tasks that have long input sequences and output sequences. This is because they generate an output sequence conditioned on an entire input sequence. In this paper; we present a Neural Transducer that can make incremental predictions as more input arrives; without redoing the entire computation. Unlike sequence-to-sequence models; the Neural Transducer computes the next-step distribution conditioned on the partially observed input sequence and the partially generated sequence. At each time step; the transducer can decide to emit zero to many output symbols. The data can be processed using an encoder and presented as input to the transducer. The discrete decision to emit a symbol at every time step makes it difficult to learn with conventional backpropagation. It is however possible to train the transducer by using a dynamic programming algorithm to generate target discrete decisions. Our experiments show that the Neural Transducer works well in settings where it is required to produce output predictions as data come in. We also find that the Neural Transducer performs well for long sequences even when attention mechanisms are not used.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6594-an-online-sequence-to-sequence-model-using-partial-conditioning/bibtex,Navdeep Jaitly; Quoc V.

The objective is to minimize the sum of agent-specific composite convex functions over agent-specific private conic constraint sets; hence; the optimal consensus decision should lie in the intersection of these private sets. We provide convergence rates in sub-optimality; infeasibility and consensus violation; examine the effect of underlying network topology on the convergence rates of the proposed decentralized algorithms; and show how to extend these methods to handle time-varying communication networks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6242-a-primal-dual-method-for-conic-constrained-distributed-optimization-problems/bibtex,Necdet Serhat Aybat; Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani

In CS; a taskmaster typically breaks down the project into small batches of tasks and assigns them to so-called workers with imperfect skill levels. The crowdsourcer then collects and analyzes the results for inference and serving the purpose of the project. In this work; the CS problem; as a human-in-the-loop computation problem; is modeled and analyzed in an information theoretic rate-distortion framework. The purpose is to identify the ultimate fidelity that one can achieve by any form of query from the crowd and any decoding (inference) algorithm with a given budget. The results are established by a joint source channel (de)coding scheme; which represent the query scheme and inference; over parallel noisy channels; which model workers with imperfect skill levels. We also present and analyze a query scheme dubbed k-ary incidence coding and study optimized query pricing in this setting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6273-fundamental-limits-of-budget-fidelity-trade-off-in-label-crowdsourcing/bibtex,Farshad Lahouti; Babak Hassibi

We find the minimax optimal predictions for a very general class of loss functions including all convex and many non-convex losses; extending a recent analysis of the problem for misclassification error. The result is a family of semi-supervised ensemble aggregation algorithms which are as efficient as linear learning by convex optimization; but are minimax optimal without any relaxations. Their decision rules take a form familiar in decision theory -- applying sigmoid functions to a notion of ensemble margin -- without the assumptions typically made in margin-based learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6597-optimal-binary-classifier-aggregation-for-general-losses/bibtex,Akshay Balsubramani; Yoav S.

2016,Disentangling factors of variation in deep representation using adversarial training,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6051-disentangling-factors-of-variation-in-deep-representation-using-adversarial-training.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6051-disentangling-factors-of-variation-in-deep-representation-using-adversarial-training,We propose a deep generative model for learning to distill the hidden factors of variation within a set of labeled observations into two complementary codes. One code describes the factors of variation relevant to solving a specified task. The other code describes the remaining factors of variation that are irrelevant to solving this task. The only available source of supervision during the training process comes from our ability to distinguish among different observations belonging to the same category. Concrete examples include multiple images of the same object from different viewpoints; or multiple speech samples from the same speaker. In both of these instances; the factors of variation irrelevant to classification are implicitly expressed by intra-class variabilities; such as the relative position of an object in an image; or the linguistic content of an utterance. Most existing approaches for solving this problem rely heavily on having access to pairs of observations only sharing a single factor of variation; e.g. different objects observed in the exact same conditions. This assumption is often not encountered in realistic settings where data acquisition is not controlled and labels for the uninformative components are not available. In this work; we propose to overcome this limitation by augmenting deep convolutional autoencoders with a form of adversarial training. Both factors of variation are implicitly captured in the organization of the learned embedding space; and can be used for solving single-image analogies.  Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method is capable of disentangling the influences of style and content factors using a flexible representation; as well as generalizing to unseen styles or content classes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6051-disentangling-factors-of-variation-in-deep-representation-using-adversarial-training/bibtex,Michael F.

In this work; we show that; by decomposing training of Structural Support Vector Machine (SVM) into a series of multiclass SVM problems connected through messages; one can replace expensive structured oracle with Factorwise Maximization Oracle (FMO) that allows efficient implementation of complexity sublinear to the factor domain. A Greedy Direction Method of Multiplier (GDMM) algorithm is proposed to exploit sparsity of messages which guarantees $\epsilon$ sub-optimality after $O(log(1/\epsilon))$ passes of FMO calls. We conduct experiments on chain-structured problems and fully-connected problems of large output domains. The proposed approach is orders-of-magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art training algorithms for Structural SVM.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6422-dual-decomposed-learning-with-factorwise-oracle-for-structural-svm-of-large-output-domain/bibtex,Ian En-Hsu Yen; Xiangru Huang; Kai Zhong; Ruohan Zhang; Pradeep K.

The model is centred on a parametric baseline hazard; and uses a Gaussian process to model variations away from it nonparametrically; as well as  dependence on covariates. As opposed to many other methods in survival analysis; our framework does not impose unnecessary constraints in the hazard rate or in the survival function. Furthermore; our model handles left; right and interval censoring mechanisms common in survival analysis. We propose a MCMC algorithm to perform inference and an approximation scheme based on random Fourier features to make computations faster. We report experimental results on synthetic and real data; showing that our model performs better than competing models such as Cox proportional hazards; ANOVA-DDP and random survival forests.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6443-gaussian-processes-for-survival-analysis/bibtex,Tamara Fernandez; Nicolas Rivera; Yee Whye Teh

If endowed with 3D understanding; agents can abstract away from the complexity of the rendering process to form stable; disentangled representations of scene elements. In this paper we learn strong deep generative models of 3D structures; and recover these structures from 2D images via probabilistic inference. We demonstrate high-quality samples and report log-likelihoods on several datasets; including ShapeNet; and establish the first benchmarks in the literature. We also show how these models and their inference networks can be trained jointly; end-to-end; and directly from 2D images without any use of ground-truth 3D labels. This demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of learning to infer 3D representations of the world in a purely unsupervised manner.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6600-unsupervised-learning-of-3d-structure-from-images/bibtex,Danilo Jimenez Rezende; S.

It enjoys practical success but is poorly understood theoretically. This paper proposes an algorithm that alternates between decoding the weights and updating the features; and shows that assuming a generative model of the data; it provably recovers the ground-truth under fairly mild conditions. In particular; its only essential requirement on features is linear independence. Furthermore; the algorithm uses ReLU to exploit the non-negativity for decoding the weights; and thus can tolerate adversarial noise that can potentially be as large as the signal; and can tolerate unbiased noise much larger than the signal. The analysis relies on a carefully designed coupling between two potential functions; which we believe is of independent interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6417-recovery-guarantee-of-non-negative-matrix-factorization-via-alternating-updates/bibtex,Yuanzhi Li; Yingyu Liang; Andrej Risteski

In this paper we ask whether there are other "lucky" settings when FTL achieves sublinear; "small" regret. In particular; we study the fundamental problem of linear prediction over a non-empty convex; compact domain. Amongst other results; we prove that the curvature of  the boundary of the domain can act as if the losses were curved: In this case; we prove that as long as the mean of the loss vectors have positive lengths bounded away from zero; FTL enjoys a logarithmic growth rate of regret; while; e.g.; for polyhedral domains and stochastic data it enjoys finite expected regret. Building on a previously known meta-algorithm; we also get an algorithm that simultaneously enjoys the worst-case guarantees and the bound available for FTL.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6455-following-the-leader-and-fast-rates-in-linear-prediction-curved-constraint-sets-and-other-regularities/bibtex,Ruitong Huang; Tor Lattimore; Andr?s Gy?rgy; Csaba Szepesvari

Despite the empirical success of nonconvex statistical optimization methods; their global dynamics; especially convergence to the desirable local minima; remain less well understood in theory. In this paper; we propose a new analytic paradigm based on diffusion processes to characterize the global dynamics of nonconvex statistical optimization. As a concrete example; we study stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for the tensor decomposition formulation of independent component analysis. In particular; we cast different phases of SGD into diffusion processes; i.e.; solutions to stochastic differential equations. Initialized from an unstable equilibrium; the global dynamics of SGD transit over three consecutive phases: (i) an unstable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process slowly departing from the initialization; (ii) the solution to an ordinary differential equation; which quickly evolves towards the desirable local minimum; and (iii) a stable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process oscillating around the desirable local minimum. Our proof techniques are based upon Stroock and Varadhan?s weak convergence of Markov chains to diffusion processes; which are of independent interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6306-online-ica-understanding-global-dynamics-of-nonconvex-optimization-via-diffusion-processes/bibtex,Chris Junchi Li; Zhaoran Wang; Han Liu

In this problem the goal is to estimate the energy consumption of each appliance based on the total energy-consumption signal of a household. The current state of the art models the problem as inference in factorial HMMs; and finds an approximate solution to the resulting quadratic integer program via quadratic programming. Here we take a more principled approach; better suited to integer programming problems; and find an approximate optimum by combining convex semidefinite relaxations with randomized rounding; as well as with a scalable ADMM method that exploits the special structure of the resulting semidefinite program.

User-provided helpfulness votes can highlight the most useful responses; but voting is a social process that can gain momentum based on the popularity of responses and the polarity of existing votes. We propose the Chinese Voting Process (CVP) which models the evolution of helpfulness votes as a self-reinforcing process dependent on position and presentation biases. We evaluate this model on Amazon product reviews and more than 80 StackExchange forums; measuring the intrinsic quality of individual responses and behavioral coefficients of different communities.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6362-beyond-exchangeability-the-chinese-voting-process/bibtex,Moontae Lee; Seok Hyun Jin; David Mimno
2016,A posteriori error bounds for joint matrix decomposition problems,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6424-a-posteriori-error-bounds-for-joint-matrix-decomposition-problems.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6424-a-posteriori-error-bounds-for-joint-matrix-decomposition-problems,Joint matrix triangularization is often used for estimating the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices; with applications in signal processing and machine learning. We consider the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization when the matrices in M are jointly diagonalizable and real; but we only observe a set M' of noise perturbed versions of the matrices in M. Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M. The bound depends only on the observable matrices in M' and the noise level. In particular; it does not depend on optimization specific properties of the triangularizer; such as its proximity to critical points; that are typical of existing bounds in the literature. To our knowledge; this is the first a posteriori bound for joint matrix decomposition. We demonstrate the bound on synthetic data for which the ground truth is known.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6424-a-posteriori-error-bounds-for-joint-matrix-decomposition-problems/bibtex,Nicolo Colombo; Nikos Vlassis
2016,A Bayesian method for reducing bias in neural representational similarity analysis,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6131-a-bayesian-method-for-reducing-bias-in-neural-representational-similarity-analysis.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6131-a-bayesian-method-for-reducing-bias-in-neural-representational-similarity-analysis,In neuroscience; the similarity matrix of neural activity patterns in response to different sensory stimuli or under different cognitive states reflects the structure of neural representational space. Existing methods derive point estimations of neural activity patterns from noisy neural imaging data; and the similarity is calculated from these point estimations. We show that this approach translates structured noise from estimated patterns into spurious bias structure in the resulting similarity matrix; which is especially severe when signal-to-noise ratio is low and experimental conditions cannot be fully randomized in a cognitive task. We propose an alternative Bayesian framework for computing representational similarity in which we treat the covariance structure of neural activity patterns as a hyper-parameter in a generative model of the neural data; and directly estimate this covariance structure from imaging data while marginalizing over the unknown activity patterns. Converting the estimated covariance structure into a correlation matrix offers a much less biased estimate of neural representational similarity. Our method can also simultaneously estimate a signal-to-noise map that informs where the learned representational structure is supported more strongly; and the learned covariance matrix can be used as a structured prior to constrain Bayesian estimation of neural activity patterns.

2016,Normalized Spectral Map Synchronization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6128-normalized-spectral-map-synchronization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6128-normalized-spectral-map-synchronization,The algorithmic advancement of synchronizing maps is important in order to solve a wide range of practice problems  with possible large-scale dataset. In this paper; we provide theoretical justifications for spectral techniques for the map synchronization problem; i.e.; it takes as input a collection of objects and noisy maps estimated between pairs of objects; and outputs clean maps between all pairs of objects. We show that a simple normalized spectral method that projects the blocks of the top eigenvectors of a data matrix to the map space leads to surprisingly good results. As the noise is modelled naturally as random permutation matrix; this algorithm NormSpecSync leads to competing theoretical guarantees as state-of-the-art convex optimization techniques; yet it is much more efficient. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm in a couple of applications; where it is optimal in both complexity and exactness among existing methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6128-normalized-spectral-map-synchronization/bibtex,Yanyao Shen; Qixing Huang; Nati Srebro; Sujay Sanghavi
2016,Full-Capacity Unitary Recurrent Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6327-full-capacity-unitary-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6327-full-capacity-unitary-recurrent-neural-networks,Recurrent neural networks are powerful models for processing sequential data; but they are generally plagued by vanishing and exploding gradient problems. Unitary recurrent neural networks (uRNNs); which use unitary recurrence matrices; have recently been proposed as a means to avoid these issues. However; in previous experiments; the recurrence matrices were restricted to be a product of parameterized unitary matrices; and an open question remains: when does such a parameterization fail to represent all unitary matrices; and how does this restricted representational capacity limit what can be learned? To address this question; we propose full-capacity uRNNs that optimize their recurrence matrix over all unitary matrices; leading to significantly improved performance over uRNNs that use a restricted-capacity recurrence matrix. Our contribution consists of two main components. First; we provide a theoretical argument to determine if a unitary parameterization has restricted capacity. Using this argument; we show that a recently proposed unitary parameterization has restricted capacity for hidden state dimension greater than 7. Second;we show how a complete; full-capacity unitary recurrence matrix can be optimized over the differentiable manifold of unitary matrices. The resulting multiplicative gradient step is very simple and does not require gradient clipping or learning rate adaptation. We confirm the utility of our claims by empirically evaluating our new full-capacity uRNNs on both synthetic and natural data; achieving superior performance compared to both LSTMs and the original restricted-capacity uRNNs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6327-full-capacity-unitary-recurrent-neural-networks/bibtex,Scott Wisdom; Thomas Powers; John Hershey; Jonathan Le Roux; Les Atlas
2016,Supervised Word Mover&#39;s Distance,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6139-supervised-word-movers-distance.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6139-supervised-word-movers-distance,Accurately measuring the similarity between text documents lies at the core of many real world applications of machine learning. These include web-search ranking; document recommendation; multi-lingual document matching; and article categorization. Recently; a new document metric; the word mover's distance (WMD); has been proposed with unprecedented results on kNN-based document classification. The WMD elevates high quality word embeddings to document metrics by formulating the distance between two documents as an optimal transport problem between the embedded words. However; the document distances are entirely unsupervised and lack a mechanism to incorporate supervision when available. In this paper we propose an efficient technique to learn a supervised metric; which we call the Supervised WMD (S-WMD) metric. Our algorithm learns document distances that measure the underlying semantic differences between documents by leveraging semantic differences between individual words discovered during supervised training. This is achieved with an linear transformation of the underlying word embedding space and tailored word-specific weights; learned to minimize the stochastic leave-one-out nearest neighbor classification error on a per-document level. We evaluate our metric on eight real-world text classification tasks on which S-WMD consistently  outperforms almost all of our 26 competitive baselines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6139-supervised-word-movers-distance/bibtex,Gao Huang; Chuan Guo; Matt J.

2016,Threshold Bandits; With and Without Censored Feedback,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6149-threshold-bandits-with-and-without-censored-feedback.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6149-threshold-bandits-with-and-without-censored-feedback,We consider the \emph{Threshold Bandit} setting; a variant of the classical multi-armed bandit problem in which the reward on each round depends on a piece of side information known as a \emph{threshold value}. The learner selects one of $K$ actions (arms); this action generates a random sample from a fixed distribution; and the action then receives a unit payoff in the event that this sample exceeds the threshold value. We consider two versions of this problem; the \emph{uncensored} and \emph{censored} case; that determine whether the sample is always observed or only when the threshold is not met. Using new tools to understand the popular UCB algorithm; we show that the uncensored case is essentially no more difficult than the classical multi-armed bandit setting. Finally we show that the censored case exhibits more challenges; but we give guarantees in the event that the sequence of threshold values is generated optimistically.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6149-threshold-bandits-with-and-without-censored-feedback/bibtex,Jacob D.

Despite the recent burst of interest in community detection under the SBM from statistical and computational points of view; there are still gaps in understanding the fundamental limits of recovery. In this paper; we consider the SBM in its full generality; where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of communities or how they grow with the number of nodes; as well as on the connectivity probabilities inside or across communities. For such stochastic block models; we provide guarantees for exact recovery via a semidefinite program as well as upper and lower bounds on SBM parameters for exact recoverability. Our results exploit the tradeoffs among the various parameters of heterogenous SBM and provide recovery guarantees for many new interesting SBM configurations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6574-exploiting-tradeoffs-for-exact-recovery-in-heterogeneous-stochastic-block-models/bibtex,Amin Jalali; Qiyang Han; Ioana Dumitriu; Maryam Fazel

The question of setting the optimal number of neighbors as well as the optimal weights has received much attention throughout the years; nevertheless this problem seems to  have remained unsettled. In this paper we offer a simple approach to locally weighted regression/classification; where we make the bias-variance tradeoff explicit.  Our formulation enables us to phrase a notion of optimal weights; and to efficiently find these weights as well as the optimal number of neighbors  efficiently and adaptively; for each data point whose value we wish to estimate. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated on several datasets; showing superior performance over standard locally weighted methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6373-k-nearest-neighbors-from-global-to-local/bibtex,Oren Anava; Kfir Levy

The receptive field size is a crucial issue in many visual tasks; as the output must respond to large enough areas in the image to capture information about large objects. We introduce the notion of an effective receptive field size; and show that it both has a Gaussian distribution and   only occupies a fraction of the full theoretical receptive field size. We analyze the effective receptive field in several architecture designs; and the effect of sub-sampling; skip connections; dropout and nonlinear activations on it. This leads to suggestions for ways to address its tendency to be too small.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6203-understanding-the-effective-receptive-field-in-deep-convolutional-neural-networks/bibtex,Wenjie Luo; Yujia Li; Raquel Urtasun; Richard Zemel

We propose gradient-based and random gradient-free methods to solve this problem. Our algorithms are based on the concept of an inexact oracle and unlike the state-of-the-art gradient-based method we manage to provide theoretically the convergence rate guarantees for both of them. Finally; we compare the performance of the proposed optimization methods with the state of the art applied to a ranking task.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6565-learning-supervised-pagerank-with-gradient-based-and-gradient-free-optimization-methods/bibtex,Lev Bogolubsky; Pavel Dvurechensky; Alexander Gasnikov; Gleb Gusev; Yurii Nesterov; Andrei M.

Motivated by several recent applications; in particular bigram models in language processing; we consider learning low-rank conditional probability matrices under expected KL-risk. This choice makes smoothing; that is the careful handling of low-probability elements; paramount. We derive an iterative algorithm that extends classical non-negative matrix factorization to naturally incorporate additive smoothing and prove that it converges to the stationary points of a penalized empirical risk. We then derive sample-complexity bounds for the global minimizer of the penalized risk and show that it is within a small factor of the optimal sample complexity. This framework generalizes to more sophisticated smoothing techniques; including absolute-discounting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6199-near-optimal-smoothing-of-structured-conditional-probability-matrices/bibtex,Moein Falahatgar; Mesrob I.

However; existing theoretical analyses of crowdsourcing systems suggest that the gain of adaptive task assignments is minimal. To bridge this gap; we investigate this question under a strictly more general probabilistic model; which has been recently introduced to model practical crowdsourcing data sets. Under this generalized Dawid-Skene model; we characterize the fundamental trade-off between budget and accuracy; and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that matches this fundamental limit. We further quantify the gain of adaptivity; by comparing the trade-off with the one for non-adaptive schemes; and confirm that the gain is significant and can be made arbitrarily large depending on the distribution of the difficulty level of the tasks at hand.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6124-achieving-budget-optimality-with-adaptive-schemes-in-crowdsourcing/bibtex,Ashish Khetan; Sewoong Oh
2016,Multi-step learning and underlying structure in statistical models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6197-multi-step-learning-and-underlying-structure-in-statistical-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6197-multi-step-learning-and-underlying-structure-in-statistical-models,In multi-step learning; where a final learning task is accomplished via a sequence of intermediate learning tasks; the intuition is that successive steps or levels transform the initial data into representations more and more ``suited" to the final learning task. A related principle arises in transfer-learning where Baxter (2000) proposed a theoretical framework to study how learning multiple tasks transforms the inductive bias of a learner. The most widespread multi-step learning approach is semi-supervised learning with two steps: unsupervised; then supervised. Several authors (Castelli-Cover; 1996; Balcan-Blum; 2005; Niyogi; 2008; Ben-David et al; 2008; Urner et al; 2011) have analyzed SSL; with Balcan-Blum (2005) proposing a version of the PAC learning framework augmented by a ``compatibility function" to link concept class and unlabeled data distribution. We propose to analyze SSL and other multi-step learning approaches; much in the spirit of Baxter's framework; by defining a learning problem generatively as a joint statistical model on $X \times Y$. This determines in a natural way the class of conditional distributions that are possible with each marginal; and amounts to an abstract form of compatibility function. It also allows to analyze both discrete and non-discrete settings. As tool for our analysis; we define a notion of $\gamma$-uniform shattering for statistical models. We use this to give conditions on the marginal and conditional models which imply an advantage for multi-step learning approaches. In particular; we recover a more general version of a result of Poggio et al (2012): under mild hypotheses a multi-step approach which learns features invariant under successive factors of a finite group of invariances has sample complexity requirements that are additive rather than multiplicative in the size of the subgroups.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6197-multi-step-learning-and-underlying-structure-in-statistical-models/bibtex,Maia Fraser

In this work; we introduce recursive maxima hunting (RMH) for variable selection in classification problems with functional data. In this context; variable selection techniques are especially attractive because they reduce the dimensionality; facilitate the interpretation and can improve the accuracy of the predictive models. The method; which is a recursive extension of maxima hunting (MH); performs variable selection by identifying the maxima of a relevance function; which measures the strength of the correlation of the predictor functional variable with the class label. At each stage; the information associated with the selected variable is removed by subtracting the conditional expectation of the process. The results of an extensive empirical evaluation are used to illustrate that; in the problems investigated; RMH has comparable or higher predictive accuracy than standard simensionality reduction techniques; such as PCA and PLS; and state-of-the-art feature selection methods for functional data; such as maxima hunting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6392-feature-selection-in-functional-data-classification-with-recursive-maxima-hunting/bibtex,Jos?

We include deterministic paths between all latent variables and the generated output; and provide a richer set of connections between computations for inference and generation; which enables more effective communication of information throughout the model during training. To improve performance on natural images; we incorporate a lightweight autoregressive model in the reconstruction distribution. These techniques permit end-to-end training of models with 10+ layers of latent variables. Experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard image modelling benchmarks; can expose latent class structure in the absence of label information; and can provide convincing imputations of occluded regions in natural images.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6141-an-architecture-for-deep-hierarchical-generative-models/bibtex,Philip Bachman

They are also of great interest to the understanding of sensory processing in cortical sensory hierarchies. The purpose of this work is to advance our theoretical understanding of the computational benefits of these architectures. Using a simple model of clustered noisy inputs and a simple learning rule; we provide analytically derived recursion relations describing the propagation of the signals along the deep network. By analysis of these equations; and defining performance measures; we show that these model networks have optimal depths.

We demonstrate how algorithms for optimizing tensor networks can be adapted to supervised learning tasks by using matrix product states (tensor trains) to parameterize non-linear kernel learning models. For the MNIST data set we obtain less than 1% test set classification error.

If the set of signals is convex and compact; and can be specified beforehand; one can use classical linear estimators that achieve a risk within a constant factor of the minimax risk. However; when the set is unspecified; designing an estimator that is blind to the hidden structure of the signal remains a challenging problem. We propose a new family of estimators to recover signals observed in Gaussian noise. Instead of specifying the set where the signal lives; we assume the existence of a well-performing linear estimator. Proposed estimators enjoy exact oracle inequalities and can be efficiently computed through convex optimization. We present several numerical illustrations that show the potential of the approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6063-structure-blind-signal-recovery/bibtex,Dmitry Ostrovsky; Zaid Harchaoui; Anatoli Juditsky; Arkadi S.

The model can be conditioned on any vector; including descriptive labels or tags; or latent embeddings created by other networks. When conditioned on class labels from the ImageNet database; the model is able to generate diverse; realistic scenes representing distinct animals; objects; landscapes and structures. When conditioned on an embedding produced by a convolutional network given a single image of an unseen face; it generates a variety of new portraits of the same person with different facial expressions; poses and lighting conditions. We also show that conditional PixelCNN can serve as a powerful decoder in an image autoencoder. Additionally; the gated convolutional layers in the proposed model improve the log-likelihood of PixelCNN to match the state-of-the-art performance of PixelRNN on ImageNet; with greatly reduced computational cost.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6527-conditional-image-generation-with-pixelcnn-decoders/bibtex,Aaron van den Oord; Nal Kalchbrenner; Lasse Espeholt; koray kavukcuoglu; Oriol Vinyals; Alex Graves

Unlike other approaches that utilize supervised learning for denoising; we do not require any additional training data. In such setting; while the ground-truth label; i.e.; the clean data; is not available; we devise ``pseudo-labels'' and a novel objective function such that DNN can be trained in a same way as supervised learning to become a discrete denoiser. We experimentally show that our resulting algorithm; dubbed as Neural DUDE; significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in several applications with a systematic rule of choosing the hyperparameter; which is an attractive feature in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6497-neural-universal-discrete-denoiser/bibtex,Taesup Moon; Seonwoo Min; Byunghan Lee; Sungroh Yoon

We propose a new type of normalizing flow; inverse autoregressive flow (IAF); that; in contrast to earlier published flows; scales well to high-dimensional latent spaces. The proposed flow consists of a chain of invertible transformations; where each transformation is based on an autoregressive neural network. In experiments; we show that IAF significantly improves upon diagonal Gaussian approximate posteriors. In addition; we demonstrate that a novel type of variational autoencoder; coupled with IAF; is competitive with neural autoregressive models in terms of attained log-likelihood on natural images; while allowing significantly faster synthesis.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6581-improved-variational-inference-with-inverse-autoregressive-flow/bibtex,Diederik P.

We consider possibly the most natural class of non-convex functions where one could hope to obtain provable guarantees: functions that are ``approximately convex''; i.e. functions $\tf: \Real^d \to \Real$ for which there exists a \emph{convex function} $f$ such that for all $x$; $|\tf(x) - f(x)| \le \errnoise$ for a fixed value $\errnoise$. We then want to minimize $\tf$; i.e. output a point $\tx$ such that $\tf(\tx) \le \min_{x} \tf(x) + \err$.   It is quite natural to conjecture that for fixed $\err$; the problem gets harder for larger $\errnoise$; however; the exact dependency of $\err$ and $\errnoise$ is not known. In this paper; we strengthen the known \emph{information theoretic} lower bounds on the trade-off between $\err$ and $\errnoise$ substantially; and exhibit an algorithm that matches these lower bounds for a large class of convex bodies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6576-algorithms-and-matching-lower-bounds-for-approximately-convex-optimization/bibtex,Andrej Risteski; Yuanzhi Li

By considering a novel problem formulation?the minimization of a sum of piecewise functions?we describe a principled and general mechanism for exploiting piecewise linear structure in convex optimization. This result leads to a theoretically justified working set algorithm and a novel screening test; which generalize and improve upon many prior results on exploiting structure in convex optimization. In empirical comparisons; we study the scalability of our methods. We find that screening scales surprisingly poorly with the size of the problem; while our working set algorithm convincingly outperforms alternative approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6043-unified-methods-for-exploiting-piecewise-linear-structure-in-convex-optimization/bibtex,Tyler B.

This equivalence provides a new understanding of kernel Bayesian inference. Moreover; the optimization problem induces a new regularization for the posterior embedding estimator; which is faster and has comparable performance to the squared regularization in kernel Bayes' rule. This regularization coincides with a former thresholding approach used in kernel POMDPs whose consistency remains to be established. Our theoretical work solves this open problem and provides consistency analysis in regression settings. Based on our optimizational formulation; we propose a flexible Bayesian posterior regularization framework which for the first time enables us to put regularization at the distribution level. We apply this method to nonparametric state-space filtering tasks with extremely nonlinear dynamics and show performance gains over all other baselines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6235-kernel-bayesian-inference-with-posterior-regularization/bibtex,Yang Song; Jun Zhu; Yong Ren

Recent advances that exploit the capacity and flexibility in this approach have expanded what kinds of models can be trained. However; as a proposal for the posterior; the capacity of the recognition network is limited; which can constrain the representational power of the generative model and increase the variance of Monte Carlo estimates. To address these issues; we introduce an iterative refinement procedure for improving the approximate posterior of the recognition network and show that training with the refined posterior is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. The advantages of refinement are further evident in an increased effective sample size; which implies a lower variance of gradient estimates.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6311-iterative-refinement-of-the-approximate-posterior-for-directed-belief-networks/bibtex,Devon Hjelm; Ruslan R.

The assortment optimization problem focuses on determining the revenue/profit maximizing subset of products from a large universe of products; it is an important decision that is commonly faced by retailers in determining what to offer their customers. There are two key challenges: (a) the Mallows distribution lacks a closed-form expression (and requires summing an exponential number of terms) to compute the choice probability and; hence; the expected revenue/profit per customer; and (b) finding the best subset may require an exhaustive search. Our key contributions are an efficiently computable closed-form expression for the choice probability under the Mallows model and a compact mixed integer linear program (MIP) formulation for the assortment problem.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6224-assortment-optimization-under-the-mallows-model/bibtex,Antoine Desir; Vineet Goyal; Srikanth Jagabathula; Danny Segev

Our objective is to return a good estimate of the optimal value function at any state while minimizing the number of calls to the generative model; i.e. the sample complexity. We propose a new algorithm; TrailBlazer; able to handle MDPs with a finite or an infinite number of transitions from state-action to next states. TrailBlazer is an adaptive algorithm that exploits possible structures of the MDP by exploring only a subset of states reachable by following near-optimal policies. We provide bounds on its sample complexity that depend on a measure of the quantity of near-optimal states. The algorithm behavior can be considered as an extension of Monte-Carlo sampling (for estimating an expectation) to problems that alternate maximization (over actions) and expectation (over next states). Finally; another appealing feature of TrailBlazer is that it is simple to implement and computationally efficient.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6253-blazing-the-trails-before-beating-the-path-sample-efficient-monte-carlo-planning/bibtex,Jean-Bastien Grill; Michal Valko; Remi Munos
2016,Learning Parametric Sparse Models for Image Super-Resolution,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6378-learning-parametric-sparse-models-for-image-super-resolution.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6378-learning-parametric-sparse-models-for-image-super-resolution,Learning accurate prior knowledge of natural images is of great importance for single image super-resolution (SR). Existing SR methods either learn the prior from the low/high-resolution patch pairs or estimate the prior models from the input low-resolution (LR) image. Specifically; high-frequency details are learned in the former methods. Though effective; they are heuristic and have limitations in dealing with blurred LR images; while the latter suffers from the limitations of frequency aliasing. In this paper; we propose to combine those two lines of ideas for image super-resolution. More specifically; the parametric sparse prior of the desirable high-resolution (HR) image patches are learned from both the input low-resolution (LR) image and a training image dataset. With the learned sparse priors; the sparse codes and thus the HR image patches can be accurately recovered by solving a sparse coding problem. Experimental results show that the proposed SR method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both subjective and objective image qualities.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6378-learning-parametric-sparse-models-for-image-super-resolution/bibtex,Yongbo Li; Weisheng Dong; Xuemei Xie; GUANGMING Shi; Xin Li; Donglai Xu

Given a natural language question about an image; our model updates the question representation iteratively by selecting image regions relevant to the query and learns to give the correct answer. Our model contains several reasoning layers; exploiting complex visual relations in the visual question answering (VQA) task. The proposed network is end-to-end trainable through back-propagation; where its weights are initialized using pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Our method is evaluated on challenging datasets of COCO-QA and VQA and yields state-of-the-art performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6261-visual-question-answering-with-question-representation-update-qru/bibtex,Ruiyu Li; Jiaya Jia

Inference is approximated by the Newton-Raphson algorithm; reduced to linear-time Kalman smoothing; which allows us to operate on several orders of magnitude larger problems than previous related work.

Unfortunately; calculating the potentials in the maximum entropy distribution is intractable [BGS14]. We provide computationally efficient versions of this principle when the mean parameters are pairwise moments: we design distributions that approximately match given pairwise moments; while having entropy which is comparable to the maximum entropy distribution matching those moments.  We additionally provide surprising applications of the approximate maximum entropy principle to designing provable variational methods for partition function calculations for Ising models without any assumptions on the potentials of the model. More precisely; we show that we can get approximation guarantees for the log-partition function comparable to those in the low-temperature limit; which is the setting of optimization of quadratic forms over the hypercube.

We introduce the Professor Forcing algorithm; which uses adversarial domain adaptation to encourage the dynamics of the recurrent network to be the same when training the network and when sampling from the network over multiple time steps. We apply Professor Forcing to language modeling; vocal synthesis on raw waveforms; handwriting generation; and image generation. Empirically we find that Professor Forcing acts as a regularizer; improving test likelihood on character level Penn Treebank and sequential MNIST. We also find that the model qualitatively improves samples; especially when sampling for a large number of time steps.  This is supported by human evaluation of sample quality.  Trade-offs between Professor Forcing and Scheduled Sampling are discussed. We produce T-SNEs showing that Professor Forcing successfully makes the dynamics of the network during training and sampling more similar.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6099-professor-forcing-a-new-algorithm-for-training-recurrent-networks/bibtex,Alex M.

2016,Efficient Neural Codes under Metabolic Constraints,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6470-efficient-neural-codes-under-metabolic-constraints.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6470-efficient-neural-codes-under-metabolic-constraints,Neural codes are inevitably shaped by various kinds of biological constraints; \emph{e.g.} noise and metabolic cost. Here we formulate a coding framework which explicitly deals with noise and the metabolic costs associated with the neural representation of information; and analytically derive the optimal neural code for monotonic response functions and arbitrary stimulus distributions. For a single neuron; the theory predicts a family of optimal response functions depending on the metabolic budget and noise characteristics. Interestingly; the well-known histogram equalization solution can be viewed as a special case when metabolic resources are unlimited. For a pair of neurons; our theory suggests that under more severe metabolic constraints; ON-OFF coding is an increasingly more efficient coding scheme compared to ON-ON or OFF-OFF. The advantage could be as large as one-fold; substantially larger than the previous estimation. Some of these predictions could be generalized to the case of large neural populations. In particular; these analytical results may provide a theoretical basis for the predominant segregation into ON- and OFF-cells in early visual processing areas. Overall; we provide a unified framework for optimal neural codes with monotonic tuning curves in the brain; and makes predictions that can be directly tested with physiology experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6470-efficient-neural-codes-under-metabolic-constraints/bibtex,Zhuo Wang; Xue-Xin Wei; Alan A.

We state and study a novel saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that is able to identify joint interactions between several  features. This method fills the gap of MI-based SFS techniques with high-order dependencies. In this high-dimensional case; the estimation of MI has prohibitively high sample complexity. We mitigate this cost using a greedy approximation and binary representatives what makes our technique able to be effectively used. The superiority of our approach is demonstrated by comparison with recently proposed interaction-aware filters and several interaction-agnostic state-of-the-art ones on ten publicly available benchmark datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6584-efficient-high-order-interaction-aware-feature-selection-based-on-conditional-mutual-information/bibtex,Alexander Shishkin; Anastasia Bezzubtseva; Alexey Drutsa; Ilia Shishkov; Ekaterina Gladkikh; Gleb Gusev; Pavel Serdyukov
2016,Dual Space Gradient Descent for Online Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6560-dual-space-gradient-descent-for-online-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6560-dual-space-gradient-descent-for-online-learning,One crucial goal in kernel online learning is to bound the model size. Common approaches employ budget maintenance procedures to restrict the model sizes using removal; projection; or merging strategies. Although projection and merging; in the literature; are known to be the most effective strategies; they demand extensive computation whilst removal strategy fails to retain information of the removed vectors. An alternative way to address the model size problem is to apply random features to approximate the kernel function. This allows the model to be maintained directly in the random feature space; hence effectively resolve the curse of kernelization. However; this approach still suffers from a serious shortcoming as it needs to use a high dimensional random feature space to achieve a sufficiently accurate kernel approximation. Consequently; it leads to a significant increase in the computational cost. To address all of these aforementioned challenges; we present in this paper the Dual Space Gradient Descent (DualSGD); a novel framework that utilizes random features as an auxiliary space to maintain information from data points removed during budget maintenance. Consequently; our approach permits the budget to be maintained in a simple; direct and elegant way while simultaneously mitigating the impact of the dimensionality issue on learning performance. We further provide convergence analysis and extensively conduct experiments on five real-world datasets to demonstrate the predictive performance and scalability of our proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6560-dual-space-gradient-descent-for-online-learning/bibtex,Trung Le; Tu Nguyen; Vu Nguyen; Dinh Phung

One approach is to recover the expert's cost function with inverse reinforcement learning; then extract a policy from that cost function with reinforcement learning. This approach is indirect and can be slow. We propose a new general framework for directly extracting a policy from data as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement learning. We show that a certain instantiation of our framework draws an analogy between imitation learning and generative adversarial networks; from which we derive a model-free imitation learning algorithm that obtains significant performance gains over existing model-free  methods in imitating complex behaviors in large; high-dimensional environments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6391-generative-adversarial-imitation-learning/bibtex,Jonathan Ho; Stefano Ermon
2016,Learning brain regions via large-scale online structured sparse dictionary learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6352-learning-brain-regions-via-large-scale-online-structured-sparse-dictionary-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6352-learning-brain-regions-via-large-scale-online-structured-sparse-dictionary-learning,We propose a multivariate online dictionary-learning method for obtaining decompositions of brain images with structured and sparse components (aka atoms). Sparsity is to be understood in the usual sense: the dictionary atoms are constrained to contain mostly zeros. This is imposed via an $\ell_1$-norm constraint. By "structured"; we mean that the atoms are piece-wise smooth and compact; thus making up blobs; as opposed to scattered patterns of activation. We propose to use a Sobolev (Laplacian) penalty to impose this type of structure. Combining the two penalties; we obtain decompositions that properly delineate brain structures from functional images. This non-trivially extends the online dictionary-learning  work of Mairal et al. (2010); at the price of only a factor of 2 or 3 on the overall running time. Just like the Mairal et al. (2010) reference method; the online nature of our proposed algorithm allows it to scale to arbitrarily sized datasets. Experiments on brain data show that our proposed method extracts structured and denoised dictionaries that are more intepretable and better capture inter-subject variability in small medium; and large-scale regimes alike; compared to state-of-the-art models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6352-learning-brain-regions-via-large-scale-online-structured-sparse-dictionary-learning/bibtex,Elvis DOHMATOB; Arthur Mensch; Gael Varoquaux; Bertrand Thirion

In particular; we consider the square loss and show that    for  a universal step-size choice; the number of passes acts as a regularization parameter; and optimal finite sample bounds  can be achieved by early-stopping. Moreover; we show that larger step-sizes are allowed when considering mini-batches. Our analysis is based on  a unifying approach; encompassing both batch and stochastic gradient methods as special cases.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6213-optimal-learning-for-multi-pass-stochastic-gradient-methods/bibtex,Junhong Lin; Lorenzo Rosasco

Although variance reduction techniques for optimizing finite-sums have witnessed tremendous attention in the recent years; existing work is limited to vector space problems. We introduce \emph{Riemannian SVRG} (\rsvrg); a new variance reduced Riemannian optimization method. We analyze \rsvrg for both geodesically  \emph{convex} and \emph{nonconvex} (smooth) functions. Our analysis reveals that \rsvrg inherits  advantages of the usual SVRG method; but with factors depending on curvature of the manifold that influence its convergence. To our knowledge; \rsvrg is the first \emph{provably fast} stochastic Riemannian method. Moreover; our paper presents the first non-asymptotic complexity analysis (novel even for the batch setting) for nonconvex Riemannian optimization. Our results have several implications; for instance; they offer a Riemannian perspective on variance reduced PCA; which promises a short; transparent convergence analysis.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6515-riemannian-svrg-fast-stochastic-optimization-on-riemannian-manifolds/bibtex,Hongyi Zhang; Sashank J.

In this work; we consider a simple yet important sub-problem: translation from textual  descriptions to If-Then programs. We devise a novel neural network architecture for this task which we train end-to-end. Specifically; we introduce Latent Attention; which computes multiplicative weights for the words in the description in a two-stage process with the goal of better leveraging the natural language structures that indicate the relevant parts for predicting program elements. Our architecture reduces the error rate by 28.57% compared to prior art. We also propose a one-shot learning scenario of If-Then program synthesis and simulate it with our existing dataset. We demonstrate a variation on the training procedure for this scenario that outperforms the original procedure; significantly closing the gap to the model trained with all data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6284-latent-attention-for-if-then-program-synthesis/bibtex,Chang Liu; Xinyun Chen; Eui Chul Shin; Mingcheng Chen; Dawn Song

This problem is particularly acute in human and animal cognition given the limited capacity of working memory; and the time pressures under which planning often occurs in the natural environment. Hierarchically organized modular representations have long been suggested to underlie the capacity of biological systems to efficiently and flexibly plan in complex environments. However; the principles underlying efficient modularization remain obscure; making it difficult to identify its behavioral and neural signatures. Here; we develop a normative theory of efficient state-space representations which partitions an environment into distinct modules by minimizing the average (information theoretic) description length of planning within the environment; thereby optimally trading off the complexity of planning across and within modules. We show that such optimal representations provide a unifying account for a diverse range of hitherto unrelated phenomena at multiple levels of behavior and neural representation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6320-efficient-state-space-modularization-for-planning-theory-behavioral-and-neural-signatures/bibtex,Daniel McNamee; Daniel M.

2016,Online Bayesian Moment Matching for Topic Modeling with Unknown Number of Topics,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6077-online-bayesian-moment-matching-for-topic-modeling-with-unknown-number-of-topics.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6077-online-bayesian-moment-matching-for-topic-modeling-with-unknown-number-of-topics,Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a very popular model for topic modeling as well as many other problems with latent groups.  It is both simple and effective.  When the number of topics (or latent groups) is unknown; the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) provides an elegant non-parametric extension; however; it is a complex model and it is difficult to incorporate prior knowledge since the distribution over topics is implicit.  We propose two new models that extend LDA in a simple and intuitive fashion by directly expressing a distribution over the number of topics.  We also propose a new online Bayesian moment matching technique to learn the parameters and the number of topics of those models based on streaming data.  The approach achieves higher log-likelihood than batch and online HDP with fixed hyperparameters on several corpora.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6077-online-bayesian-moment-matching-for-topic-modeling-with-unknown-number-of-topics/bibtex,Wei-Shou Hsu; Pascal Poupart
2016,Provable Efficient Online Matrix Completion via Non-convex Stochastic Gradient Descent,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6204-provable-efficient-online-matrix-completion-via-non-convex-stochastic-gradient-descent.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6204-provable-efficient-online-matrix-completion-via-non-convex-stochastic-gradient-descent,Matrix completion; where we wish to recover a low rank matrix by observing a few entries from it; is a widely studied problem in both theory and practice with wide applications. Most of the provable algorithms so far on this problem have been restricted to the offline setting where they provide an estimate of the unknown matrix using all observations simultaneously. However; in many applications; the online version; where we observe one entry at a time and dynamically update our estimate; is more appealing. While existing algorithms are efficient for the offline setting; they could be highly inefficient for the online setting.  In this paper; we propose the first provable; efficient online algorithm for matrix completion. Our algorithm starts from an initial estimate of the matrix and then performs non-convex stochastic gradient descent (SGD). After every observation; it performs a fast update involving only one row of two tall matrices; giving near linear total runtime. Our algorithm can be naturally used in the offline setting as well; where it gives competitive sample complexity and runtime to state of the art algorithms. Our proofs introduce a general framework to show that SGD updates tend to stay away from saddle surfaces and could be of broader interests to other non-convex problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6204-provable-efficient-online-matrix-completion-via-non-convex-stochastic-gradient-descent/bibtex,Chi Jin; Sham M.

We show that any single pass streaming algorithm using sublinear memory in the size of the stream will fail to provide any non-trivial approximation guarantees for SSC. Hence; we consider a relaxed version of SSC; where we only seek to find a partial cover. We design the first Efficient bicriteria Submodular Cover Streaming (ESC-Streaming) algorithm for this problem; and provide theoretical guarantees for its performance supported by numerical evidence. Our algorithm finds solutions that are competitive with the near-optimal offline greedy algorithm despite requiring only a single pass over the data stream. In our numerical experiments; we evaluate the performance of ESC-Streaming on active set selection and large-scale graph cover problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6175-an-efficient-streaming-algorithm-for-the-submodular-cover-problem/bibtex,Ashkan Norouzi-Fard; Abbas Bazzi; Ilija Bogunovic; Marwa El Halabi; Ya-Ping Hsieh; Volkan Cevher

Here we introduce the interaction network; a model which can reason about how objects in complex systems interact; supporting dynamical predictions; as well as inferences about the abstract properties of the system. Our model takes graphs as input; performs object- and relation-centric reasoning in a way that is analogous to a simulation; and is implemented using deep neural networks. We evaluate its ability to reason about several challenging physical domains: n-body problems; rigid-body collision; and non-rigid dynamics. Our results show it can be trained to accurately simulate the physical trajectories of dozens of objects over thousands of time steps; estimate abstract quantities such as energy; and generalize automatically to systems with different numbers and configurations of objects and relations. Our interaction network implementation is the first general-purpose; learnable physics engine; and a powerful general framework for reasoning about object and relations in a wide variety of complex real-world domains.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6418-interaction-networks-for-learning-about-objects-relations-and-physics/bibtex,Peter Battaglia; Razvan Pascanu; Matthew Lai; Danilo Jimenez Rezende; koray kavukcuoglu
2016,Tagger: Deep Unsupervised Perceptual Grouping,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6067-tagger-deep-unsupervised-perceptual-grouping.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6067-tagger-deep-unsupervised-perceptual-grouping,We present a framework for efficient perceptual inference that explicitly reasons about the segmentation of its inputs and features.  Rather than being trained for any specific segmentation; our framework learns the grouping process in an unsupervised manner or alongside any supervised task. We enable a neural network to group the representations of different objects in an iterative manner through a differentiable mechanism.  We achieve very fast convergence by allowing the system to amortize the joint iterative inference of the groupings and their representations.  In contrast to many other recently proposed methods for addressing multi-object scenes; our system does not assume the inputs to be images and can therefore directly handle other modalities. We evaluate our method on multi-digit classification of very cluttered images that require texture segmentation. Remarkably our method achieves improved classification performance over convolutional networks despite being fully connected; by making use of the grouping mechanism. Furthermore; we observe that our system greatly improves upon the semi-supervised result of a baseline Ladder network on our dataset. These results are evidence that grouping is a powerful tool that can help to improve sample efficiency.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6067-tagger-deep-unsupervised-perceptual-grouping/bibtex,Klaus Greff; Antti Rasmus; Mathias Berglund; Tele Hao; Harri Valpola; J?rgen Schmidhuber

Interpreting these recordings requires scalable and accurate automated methods for spike sorting; which should minimize the time required for manual curation of the results. Here we introduce KiloSort; a new integrated spike sorting framework that uses template matching both during spike detection and during spike clustering. KiloSort models the electrical voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times; which allows overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Unlike previous algorithms that compress the data with PCA; KiloSort operates on the raw data which allows it to construct a more accurate model of the waveforms. Processing times are faster than in previous algorithms thanks to batch-based optimization on GPUs. We compare KiloSort to an established algorithm and show favorable performance; at much reduced processing times. A novel post-clustering merging step based on the continuity of the templates further reduced substantially the number of manual operations required on this data; for the neurons with near-zero error rates; paving the way for fully automated spike sorting of multichannel electrode recordings.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6326-fast-and-accurate-spike-sorting-of-high-channel-count-probes-with-kilosort/bibtex,Marius Pachitariu; Nicholas A.

Although there exist numerous algorithms for this problem; it remains theoretically unexplored how the statistical accuracies and computational efficiency of these algorithms depend on the degree of supervision; which is quantified by $\alpha$. In this paper; we characterize the effect of $\alpha$ by establishing the information-theoretic and computational boundaries; namely; the minimax-optimal statistical accuracy that can be achieved by all algorithms; and polynomial-time algorithms under an oracle computational model. For small $\alpha$; our result shows a gap between these two boundaries; which represents the computational price of achieving the information-theoretic boundary due to the lack of supervision. Interestingly; we also show that this gap narrows as $\alpha$ increases. In other words; having more supervision; i.e.; more correct labels; not only improves the optimal statistical accuracy as expected; but also enhances the computational efficiency for achieving such accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6518-more-supervision-less-computation-statistical-computational-tradeoffs-in-weakly-supervised-learning/bibtex,Xinyang Yi; Zhaoran Wang; Zhuoran Yang; Constantine Caramanis; Han Liu
2016,Ancestral Causal Inference,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6266-ancestral-causal-inference.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6266-ancestral-causal-inference,Constraint-based causal discovery from limited data is a notoriously difficult challenge due to the many borderline independence test decisions.  Several approaches to improve the reliability of the predictions by exploiting redundancy in the independence information have been proposed recently. Though promising; existing approaches can still be greatly improved in terms of accuracy and scalability. We present a novel method that reduces the combinatorial explosion of the search space by using a more coarse-grained representation of causal information; drastically reducing computation time. Additionally; we propose a method to score causal predictions based on their confidence. Crucially; our implementation also allows one to easily combine observational and interventional data and to incorporate various types of available background knowledge.  We prove soundness and asymptotic consistency of our method and demonstrate that it can outperform the state-of-the-art on synthetic data; achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We illustrate its practical feasibility by applying it on a challenging protein data set.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6266-ancestral-causal-inference/bibtex,Sara Magliacane; Tom Claassen; Joris M.

2016,An urn model for majority voting in classification ensembles,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6120-an-urn-model-for-majority-voting-in-classification-ensembles.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6120-an-urn-model-for-majority-voting-in-classification-ensembles,In this work we analyze the class prediction of parallel randomized ensembles by majority voting as an urn model. For a given test instance; the ensemble can be viewed as an urn of marbles of different colors. A marble represents an individual classifier. Its color represents the class label prediction of the corresponding classifier. The sequential querying of classifiers in the ensemble can be seen as draws without replacement from the urn. An analysis of this classical urn model based on the hypergeometric distribution makes it possible to estimate the confidence on the outcome of majority voting when only a fraction of the individual predictions is known. These estimates can be used to speed up the prediction by the ensemble. Specifically; the aggregation of votes can be halted when the confidence in the final prediction is sufficiently high. If one assumes a uniform prior for the distribution of possible votes the analysis is shown to be equivalent to a previous one based on Dirichlet distributions. The advantage of the current approach is that prior knowledge on the possible vote outcomes can be readily incorporated in a Bayesian framework. We show how incorporating this type of problem-specific knowledge into the statistical analysis of majority voting leads to faster classification by the ensemble and allows us to estimate the expected average speed-up beforehand.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6120-an-urn-model-for-majority-voting-in-classification-ensembles/bibtex,Victor Soto; Alberto Su?rez; Gonzalo Martinez-Mu?oz

We quantify the friendliness of stochastic environments by means of the well-known Bernstein (a.k.a. generalized Tsybakov margin) condition. For two recent algorithms (Squint for the Hedge setting and MetaGrad for online convex optimization) we show that the particular form of their data-dependent individual-sequence regret guarantees implies that they adapt automatically to the Bernstein parameters of the stochastic environment. We prove that these algorithms attain fast rates in their respective settings both in expectation and with high probability.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6474-combining-adversarial-guarantees-and-stochastic-fast-rates-in-online-learning/bibtex,Wouter M.

We characterize a large class of loss functions that allows to naturally embed structured outputs in a linear space.  We exploit this fact to  design learning  algorithms using a surrogate loss approach and regularization techniques.   We prove universal consistency and finite sample bounds characterizing the generalization properties of the proposed method. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6093-a-consistent-regularization-approach-for-structured-prediction/bibtex,Carlo Ciliberto; Lorenzo Rosasco; Alessandro Rudi

An unknown set of $\alpha n$ workers generate reliable ratings; while the remaining workers may behave arbitrarily and possibly adversarially. The manager of the experiment can also manually evaluate the quality of a small number of items; and wishes to curate together almost all of the high-quality items with at most an fraction of low-quality items. Perhaps surprisingly; we show that this is possible with an amount of work required of the manager; and each worker; that does not scale with n: the dataset can be curated with $\tilde{O}(1/\beta\alpha\epsilon^4)$ ratings per worker; and $\tilde{O}(1/\beta\epsilon^2)$ ratings by the manager; where $\beta$ is the fraction of high-quality items. Our results extend to the more general setting of peer prediction; including peer grading in online classrooms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6440-avoiding-imposters-and-delinquents-adversarial-crowdsourcing-and-peer-prediction/bibtex,Jacob Steinhardt; Gregory Valiant; Moses Charikar

We analyze existing extensions of spectral clustering to signed networks. It turns out that existing approaches do not recover the ground truth clustering in several situations where either the positive or the negative network structures contain no noise. Our analysis shows that these problems arise as existing approaches take some form of arithmetic mean of the Laplacians of the positive and negative part. As a solution we propose to use the geometric mean of the Laplacians of positive and negative part and show that it outperforms the existing approaches. While the geometric mean of matrices is computationally expensive; we show that eigenvectors of the geometric mean can be computed efficiently; leading to a numerical scheme for sparse matrices which is of independent interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6164-clustering-signed-networks-with-the-geometric-mean-of-laplacians/bibtex,Pedro Mercado; Francesco Tudisco; Matthias Hein

This setup includes well-studied problems such as compressive sensing and low-rank matrix recovery. We show how to design more efficient algorithms for the union-of subspace recovery problem by using *approximate* projections. Instantiating our general framework for the low-rank matrix recovery problem gives the fastest provable running time for an algorithm with optimal sample complexity. Moreover; we give fast approximate projections for 2D histograms; another well-studied low-dimensional model of data. We complement our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating that our framework also leads to improved time and sample complexity empirically.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6484-fast-recovery-from-a-union-of-subspaces/bibtex,Chinmay Hegde; Piotr Indyk; Ludwig Schmidt
2016,Incremental Variational Sparse Gaussian Process Regression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6473-incremental-variational-sparse-gaussian-process-regression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6473-incremental-variational-sparse-gaussian-process-regression,Recent work on scaling up Gaussian process regression (GPR) to large datasets has primarily focused on sparse GPR; which leverages a small set of basis functions to approximate the full Gaussian process during inference.  However; the majority of these approaches are batch methods that operate on the entire training dataset at once; precluding the use of datasets that are streaming or too large to fit into memory. Although previous work has considered incrementally solving variational sparse GPR; most algorithms fail to update the basis functions and therefore perform suboptimally. We propose a novel incremental learning algorithm for variational sparse GPR based on stochastic mirror ascent of probability densities in reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This new formulation allows our algorithm to update basis functions online in accordance with the manifold structure of probability densities for fast convergence. We conduct several experiments and show that our proposed approach achieves better empirical performance in terms of prediction error than  the recent state-of-the-art incremental solutions to variational sparse GPR.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6473-incremental-variational-sparse-gaussian-process-regression/bibtex,Ching-An Cheng; Byron Boots
2016,LightRNN: Memory and Computation-Efficient Recurrent Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6512-lightrnn-memory-and-computation-efficient-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6512-lightrnn-memory-and-computation-efficient-recurrent-neural-networks,Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performances in many natural language processing tasks; such as language modeling and machine translation. However; when the vocabulary is large; the RNN model will become very big (e.g.; possibly beyond the memory capacity of a GPU device) and its training will become very inefficient. In this work; we propose a novel technique to tackle this challenge. The key idea is to use 2-Component (2C) shared embedding for word representations. We allocate every word in the vocabulary into a table; each row of which is associated with a vector; and each column associated with another vector. Depending on its position in the table; a word is jointly represented by two components: a row vector and a column vector. Since the words in the same row share the row vector and the words in the same column share the column vector; we only need $2 \sqrt{|V|}$ vectors to represent a vocabulary of $|V|$ unique words; which are far less than the $|V|$ vectors required by existing approaches. Based on the 2-Component shared embedding; we design a new RNN algorithm and evaluate it using the language modeling task on several benchmark datasets. The results show that our algorithm significantly reduces the model size and speeds up the training process; without sacrifice of accuracy (it achieves similar; if not better; perplexity as compared to state-of-the-art language models). Remarkably; on the One-Billion-Word benchmark Dataset; our algorithm achieves comparable perplexity to previous language models; whilst reducing the model size by a factor of 40-100; and speeding up the training process by a factor of 2. We name our proposed algorithm \emph{LightRNN} to reflect its very small model size and very high training speed.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6512-lightrnn-memory-and-computation-efficient-recurrent-neural-networks/bibtex,Xiang Li; Tao Qin; Jian Yang; Tieyan Liu

This field covers different settings like semi-supervised learning; learning with label proportions; multi-instance learning; noise-tolerant learning; etc. This paper presents a generic framework to deal with these weakly labeled scenarios. We introduce the beta-risk as a generalized formulation of the standard empirical risk based on surrogate margin-based loss functions. This risk allows us to express the reliability on the labels and to derive different kinds of learning algorithms. We specifically focus on SVMs and propose a soft margin beta-svm algorithm  which behaves better that the state of the art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6156-beta-risk-a-new-surrogate-risk-for-learning-from-weakly-labeled-data/bibtex,Valentina Zantedeschi; R?mi Emonet; Marc Sebban
2016,Backprop KF: Learning Discriminative Deterministic State Estimators,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6090-backprop-kf-learning-discriminative-deterministic-state-estimators.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6090-backprop-kf-learning-discriminative-deterministic-state-estimators,Generative state estimators based on probabilistic filters and smoothers are one of the most popular classes of state estimators for robots and autonomous vehicles. However; generative models have limited capacity to handle rich sensory observations; such as camera images; since they must model the entire distribution over sensor readings. Discriminative models do not suffer from this limitation; but are typically more complex to train as latent variable models for state estimation. We present an alternative approach where the parameters of the latent state distribution are directly optimized as a deterministic computation graph; resulting in a simple and effective gradient descent algorithm for training discriminative state estimators. We show that this procedure can be used to train state estimators that use complex input; such as raw camera images; which must be processed using expressive nonlinear function approximators such as convolutional neural networks. Our model can be viewed as a type of recurrent neural network; and the connection to probabilistic filtering allows us to design a network architecture that is particularly well suited for state estimation. We evaluate our approach on synthetic tracking task with raw image inputs and on the visual odometry task in the KITTI dataset. The results show significant improvement over both standard generative approaches and regular recurrent neural networks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6090-backprop-kf-learning-discriminative-deterministic-state-estimators/bibtex,Tuomas Haarnoja; Anurag Ajay; Sergey Levine; Pieter Abbeel
2016,Maximal Sparsity with Deep Networks?,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6346-maximal-sparsity-with-deep-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6346-maximal-sparsity-with-deep-networks,The iterations of many sparse estimation algorithms are comprised of a fixed linear filter cascaded with a thresholding nonlinearity; which collectively resemble a typical neural network layer.  Consequently; a lengthy sequence of algorithm iterations can be viewed as a deep network with shared; hand-crafted layer weights.  It is therefore quite natural to examine the degree to which a learned network model might act as a viable surrogate for traditional sparse estimation in domains where ample training data is available.  While the possibility of a reduced computational budget is readily apparent when a ceiling is imposed on the number of layers; our work primarily focuses on estimation accuracy.  In particular; it is well-known that when a signal dictionary has coherent columns; as quantified by a large RIP constant; then most tractable iterative algorithms are unable to find maximally sparse representations.  In contrast; we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically the potential for a trained deep network to recover minimal $\ell_0$-norm representations in regimes where existing methods fail.  The resulting system; which can effectively learn novel iterative sparse estimation algorithms; is deployed on a practical photometric stereo estimation problem; where the goal is to remove sparse outliers that can disrupt the estimation of surface normals from a 3D scene.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6346-maximal-sparsity-with-deep-networks/bibtex,Bo Xin; Yizhou Wang; Wen Gao; David Wipf; Baoyuan Wang

Such a danger is facing us with word embedding; a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use; as we describe; often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically; gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second; gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties; we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes; such as the association between the words receptionist and female; while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female.  Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks; we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6228-man-is-to-computer-programmer-as-woman-is-to-homemaker-debiasing-word-embeddings/bibtex,Tolga Bolukbasi; Kai-Wei Chang; James Y.

There is no good reason for this restriction. Synapses have dynamics at many different time-scales and this suggests that artificial neural networks might benefit from variables that change slower than activities but much faster than the standard weights.  These ``fast weights'' can be used to store temporary memories of the recent past and they provide a neurally plausible way of implementing the type of attention to the past that has recently proven helpful in sequence-to-sequence models. By using fast weights we can avoid the need to store copies of neural activity patterns.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6057-using-fast-weights-to-attend-to-the-recent-past/bibtex,Jimmy Ba; Geoffrey E.

Our approach is most suitable in the setting where it is computationally advantageous to process smooth term in the decomposition with its stochastic gradient estimate and the other two functions separately with their proximal operators; such as doubly regularized empirical risk minimization problems. We prove the convergence characterization of the proposed algorithm in expectation under the standard assumptions for the stochastic gradient estimate of the smooth term. Our method operates in the primal space and can be considered as a stochastic extension of the three-operator splitting method. Finally; numerical evidence supports the effectiveness of our method in real-world problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6127-stochastic-three-composite-convex-minimization/bibtex,Alp Yurtsever; Bang Cong Vu; Volkan Cevher

In the limit; this formulation coincides with the classical deterministic methods; which have been used as higher-order initial value problem solvers for over a century. Furthermore; the natural probabilistic framework provided by the GP formulation allows us to derive probabilistic versions of these methods; in the spirit of a number of other probabilistic ODE solvers presented in the recent literature. In contrast to higher-order Runge-Kutta methods; which require multiple intermediate function evaluations per step; Adams family methods make use of previous function evaluations; so that increased accuracy arising from a higher-order multistep approach comes at very little additional computational cost. We show that through a careful choice of covariance function for the GP; the posterior mean and standard deviation over the numerical solution can be made to exactly coincide with the value given by the deterministic method and its local truncation error respectively. We provide a rigorous proof of the convergence of these new methods; as well as an empirical investigation (up to fifth order) demonstrating their convergence rates in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6356-probabilistic-linear-multistep-methods/bibtex,Onur Teymur; Kostas Zygalakis; Ben Calderhead

More precisely; we focus in detail on the cases of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ losses; and contrast them with the usual $\ell_2$ loss.While these losses are routinely used to account for either sparse ($\ell_1$ loss) or uniform ($\ell_\infty$ loss) noise models; a theoretical analysis of their performance is still lacking. In this article; we extend the existing theory from the smooth $\ell_2$ case to these non-smooth cases. We derive a sharp condition which ensures that the support of the vector to recover is stable to small additive noise in the observations; as long as the loss constraint size is tuned proportionally to the noise level. A distinctive feature of our theory is that it also explains what happens when the support is unstable. While the support is not stable anymore; we identify an "extended support" and show that this extended support is stable to small additive noise. To exemplify the usefulness of our theory; we give a detailed numerical analysis of the support stability/instability of compressed sensing recovery with these different losses. This highlights different parameter regimes; ranging from total support stability to progressively increasing support instability.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6559-sparse-support-recovery-with-non-smooth-loss-functions/bibtex,K?vin Degraux; Gabriel Peyr?; Jalal Fadili; Laurent Jacques

While the functional roles of some plasticity mechanisms are well-understood; it remains unclear how changes in neural excitability contribute to learning. Here; we develop a normative interpretation of intrinsic plasticity (IP) as a key component of unsupervised learning. We introduce a novel generative mixture model that accounts for the class-specific statistics of stimulus intensities; and we derive a neural circuit that learns the input classes and their intensities. We will analytically show that inference and learning for our generative model can be achieved by a neural circuit with intensity-sensitive neurons equipped with a specific form of IP. Numerical experiments verify our analytical derivations and show robust behavior for artificial and natural stimuli. Our results link IP to non-trivial input statistics; in particular the statistics of stimulus intensities for classes to which a neuron is sensitive. More generally; our work paves the way toward new classification algorithms that are robust to intensity variations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6582-neurons-equipped-with-intrinsic-plasticity-learn-stimulus-intensity-statistics/bibtex,Travis Monk; Cristina Savin; J?rg L?cke

We suggest to replace this metric with a locally adaptive; smoothly changing (Riemannian) metric that favors regions of high local density. The resulting locally adaptive normal distribution (LAND) is a generalization of the normal distribution to the "manifold" setting; where data is assumed to lie near a potentially low-dimensional manifold embedded in R^D. The LAND is parametric; depending only on a mean and a covariance; and is the maximum entropy distribution under the given metric. The underlying metric is; however; non-parametric. We develop a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer the distribution parameters that relies on a combination of gradient descent and Monte Carlo integration. We further extend the LAND to mixture models; and provide the corresponding EM algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of the LAND to fit non-trivial probability distributions over both synthetic data; and EEG measurements of human sleep.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6503-a-locally-adaptive-normal-distribution/bibtex,Georgios Arvanitidis; Lars K.

This is infeasible for safety critical applications such as robotics; where even a single unsafe action may cause system failure or harm the environment. In this paper; we address the problem of safely exploring finite Markov decision processes (MDP). We define safety in terms of an a priori unknown safety constraint that depends on states and actions and satisfies certain regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian process prior. We develop a novel algorithm; SAFEMDP; for this task and prove that it completely explores the safely reachable part of the MDP without violating the safety constraint. To achieve this; it cautiously explores safe states and actions in order to gain statistical confidence about the safety of unvisited state-action pairs from noisy observations collected while navigating the environment. Moreover; the algorithm explicitly considers reachability when exploring the MDP; ensuring that it does not get stuck in any state with no safe way out. We demonstrate our method on digital terrain models for the task of exploring an unknown map with a rover.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6358-safe-exploration-in-finite-markov-decision-processes-with-gaussian-processes/bibtex,Matteo Turchetta; Felix Berkenkamp; Andreas Krause

We propose to adaptively normalize the targets used in the learning updates.  This is important in value-based reinforcement learning; where the magnitude of appropriate value approximations can change over time when we update the policy of behavior. Our main motivation is prior work on learning to play Atari games; where the rewards were clipped to a predetermined range. This clipping facilitates learning across many different games with a single learning algorithm; but a clipped reward function can result in qualitatively different behavior. Using adaptive normalization we can remove this domain-specific heuristic without diminishing overall performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6076-learning-values-across-many-orders-of-magnitude/bibtex,Hado P. van Hasselt; Arthur Guez; Arthur Guez; Matteo Hessel; Volodymyr Mnih; David Silver
2016,Edge-exchangeable graphs and sparsity,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6586-edge-exchangeable-graphs-and-sparsity.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6586-edge-exchangeable-graphs-and-sparsity,Many popular network models rely on the assumption of (vertex) exchangeability; in which the distribution of the graph is invariant to relabelings of the vertices. However; the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that these graphs are dense or empty with probability one; whereas many real-world graphs are sparse. We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs; which we call edge exchangeability; in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models; unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable; can exhibit sparsity. To do so; we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015); models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular; our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases; rather than adding new atoms to the measure.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6586-edge-exchangeable-graphs-and-sparsity/bibtex,Diana Cai; Trevor Campbell; Tamara Broderick
2016,Completely random measures for modelling block-structured sparse networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6521-completely-random-measures-for-modelling-block-structured-sparse-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6521-completely-random-measures-for-modelling-block-structured-sparse-networks,Statistical methods for network data often parameterize the edge-probability by attributing latent traits such as block structure to the vertices and assume exchangeability in the sense of the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem. These assumptions are however incompatible with traits found in real-world networks such as a power-law degree-distribution. Recently; Caron & Fox (2014) proposed the use of a different notion of exchangeability after Kallenberg (2005) and obtained a network model which permits edge-inhomogeneity; such as a power-law degree-distribution whilst retaining desirable statistical properties. However; this model does not capture latent vertex traits such as block-structure. In this work we re-introduce the use of block-structure for network models obeying Kallenberg?s notion of exchangeability and thereby obtain a collapsed model which both admits the inference of block-structure and edge inhomogeneity. We derive a simple expression for the likelihood and an efficient sampling method. The obtained model is not significantly more difficult to implement than existing approaches to block-modelling and performs well on real network datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6521-completely-random-measures-for-modelling-block-structured-sparse-networks/bibtex,Tue Herlau; Mikkel N.

In this paper; we address this question by introducing a generalization of the maximum entropy principle. Applying this principle to sets of distributions with marginal on X constrained to be the empirical marginal; we provide a minimax interpretation of the maximum likelihood problem over generalized linear models as well as some popular regularization schemes. For quadratic and logarithmic loss functions we revisit well-known linear and logistic regression models. Moreover; for the 0-1 loss we derive a classifier which we call the minimax SVM.

2016,Batched Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization via Determinantal Point Processes,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6452-batched-gaussian-process-bandit-optimization-via-determinantal-point-processes.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6452-batched-gaussian-process-bandit-optimization-via-determinantal-point-processes,Gaussian Process bandit optimization has emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing noisy black box functions. One example in machine learning is hyper-parameter optimization where each evaluation of the target function may require training a model which may involve days or even weeks of computation. Most methods for this so-called ?Bayesian optimization? only allow sequential exploration of the parameter space. However; it is often desirable to propose batches or sets of parameter values to explore simultaneously; especially when there are large parallel processing facilities at our disposal. Batch methods require modeling the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch; which can be expensive in complex scenarios. In this paper; we propose a new approach for parallelizing Bayesian optimization by modeling the diversity of a batch via Determinantal point processes (DPPs) whose kernels are learned automatically. This allows us to generalize a previous result as well as prove better regret bounds based on DPP sampling. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world robotics and hyper-parameter optimization tasks indicate that our DPP-based methods; especially those based on DPP sampling; outperform state-of-the-art methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6452-batched-gaussian-process-bandit-optimization-via-determinantal-point-processes/bibtex,Tarun Kathuria; Amit Deshpande; Pushmeet Kohli

Protein structure is strongly related to protein function; thus structure prediction is a crucial task on the way to solve many biological questions. A contact map is a compact representation of the three-dimensional structure of a protein via the pairwise contacts between the amino acid constituting the protein. We use a convolutional network to calculate protein contact maps from inferred statistical coupling between positions in the protein sequence. The input to the network has an image-like structure amenable to convolutions; but every "pixel" instead of color channels contains a bipartite undirected edge-weighted graph. We propose several methods for treating such "graph-valued images" in a convolutional network. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. It also allows for a great flexibility with regard to the input data; which makes it useful for studying a wide range of problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6488-protein-contact-prediction-from-amino-acid-co-evolution-using-convolutional-networks-for-graph-valued-images/bibtex,Vladimir Golkov; Marcin J.

2016,Mapping Estimation for Discrete Optimal Transport,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6312-mapping-estimation-for-discrete-optimal-transport.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6312-mapping-estimation-for-discrete-optimal-transport,We are interested in the computation of the transport map of an Optimal Transport problem. Most of the computational approaches of Optimal Transport use the Kantorovich relaxation of the problem to learn a probabilistic coupling $\mgamma$ but do not address the problem of learning the underlying transport map $\funcT$ linked to the original Monge problem. Consequently; it lowers the potential usage of such methods in contexts where out-of-samples computations are mandatory. In this paper we propose a new way to jointly learn the coupling and an approximation of the transport map. We use a jointly convex formulation which can be efficiently optimized. Additionally; jointly learning the coupling and the transport map allows to smooth the result of the Optimal Transport and generalize it to out-of-samples examples. Empirically; we show the interest and the relevance of our method in two tasks: domain adaptation and image editing.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6312-mapping-estimation-for-discrete-optimal-transport/bibtex,Micha?l Perrot; Nicolas Courty; R?mi Flamary; Amaury Habrard
2016,Linear Feature Encoding for Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6305-linear-feature-encoding-for-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6305-linear-feature-encoding-for-reinforcement-learning,Feature construction is of vital importance in reinforcement learning; as the quality of a value function or policy is largely determined by the corresponding features. The recent successes of deep reinforcement learning (RL) only increase the importance of understanding feature construction. Typical deep RL approaches use a linear output layer; which means that deep RL can be interpreted as a feature construction/encoding network followed by linear value function approximation. This paper develops and evaluates a theory of linear feature encoding. We extend theoretical results on feature quality for linear value function approximation from the uncontrolled case to the controlled case. We then develop a supervised linear feature encoding method that is motivated by insights from linear value function approximation theory; as well as empirical successes from deep RL. The resulting encoder is a surprisingly effective method for linear value function approximation using raw images as inputs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6305-linear-feature-encoding-for-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Zhao Song; Ronald E.

Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings; where prior knowledge; resource limitations; or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures; and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures; for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary; this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs); yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures; we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6182-fast-mixing-markov-chains-for-strongly-rayleigh-measures-dpps-and-constrained-sampling/bibtex,Chengtao Li; Suvrit Sra; Stefanie Jegelka

They exactly describe dynamics of finite-rank systems and can be efficiently and consistently estimated through spectral learning under the assumption of identically distributed data. In this paper; we investigate the properties of spectral learning without this assumption due to the requirements of analyzing large-time scale systems; and show that the equilibrium dynamics of a system can be extracted from nonequilibrium observation data by imposing an equilibrium constraint. In addition; we propose a binless extension of spectral learning for continuous data. In comparison with the other continuous-valued spectral algorithms; the binless algorithm can achieve consistent estimation of equilibrium dynamics with only linear complexity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6191-spectral-learning-of-dynamic-systems-from-nonequilibrium-data/bibtex,Hao Wu; Frank Noe
2016,Learning Deep Embeddings with Histogram Loss,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6464-learning-deep-embeddings-with-histogram-loss.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6464-learning-deep-embeddings-with-histogram-loss,We suggest a new loss for learning deep embeddings. The key characteristics of the new loss is the absence of tunable parameters and very good results obtained across a range of datasets and problems. The loss is computed by estimating two distribution of similarities for positive (matching) and negative (non-matching) point pairs; and then computing the probability of a positive pair to have a lower similarity score than a negative pair based on these probability estimates. We show that these operations can be performed in a simple and piecewise-differentiable manner using 1D histograms with soft assignment operations. This makes the proposed loss suitable for learning deep embeddings using stochastic optimization. The experiments reveal favourable results compared to recently proposed loss functions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6464-learning-deep-embeddings-with-histogram-loss/bibtex,Evgeniya Ustinova; Victor Lempitsky
2016,Fast Algorithms for Robust PCA via Gradient Descent,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6445-fast-algorithms-for-robust-pca-via-gradient-descent.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6445-fast-algorithms-for-robust-pca-via-gradient-descent,We consider the problem of Robust PCA in the fully and partially observed settings. Without corruptions; this is the well-known matrix completion problem. From a statistical standpoint this problem has been recently well-studied; and conditions on when recovery is possible (how many observations do we need; how many corruptions can we tolerate) via polynomial-time algorithms is by now understood. This paper presents and analyzes a non-convex optimization approach that greatly reduces the computational complexity of the above problems; compared to the best available algorithms. In particular; in the fully observed case; with $r$ denoting rank and $d$ dimension; we reduce the complexity from $O(r^2d^2\log(1/\epsilon))$ to $O(rd^2\log(1/\epsilon))$ -- a big savings when the rank is big. For the partially observed case; we show the complexity of our algorithm is no more than $O(r^4d\log(d)\log(1/\epsilon))$. Not only is this the best-known run-time for a provable algorithm under partial observation; but in the setting where $r$ is small compared to $d$; it also allows for near-linear-in-$d$ run-time that can be exploited in the fully-observed case as well; by simply running our algorithm on a subset of the observations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6445-fast-algorithms-for-robust-pca-via-gradient-descent/bibtex,Xinyang Yi; Dohyung Park; Yudong Chen; Constantine Caramanis

However; softmax estimation is very expensive for large scale inference because of the high cost associated with computing the normalizing constant. Here; we introduce an efficient approximation to softmax probabilities which takes the form of a rigorous lower bound on the exact probability. This bound is expressed as a product over pairwise probabilities and it leads to scalable estimation based on stochastic optimization. It allows us to perform doubly stochastic estimation by subsampling both training instances and class labels. We show that the new bound has interesting theoretical properties and we demonstrate its use in classification problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6468-one-vs-each-approximation-to-softmax-for-scalable-estimation-of-probabilities/bibtex,Michalis Titsias RC AUEB

At train-time the binary weights and activations are used for computing the parameter gradients. During the forward pass; BNNs drastically reduce memory size and accesses; and replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations; which is expected to  substantially improve power-efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of BNNs; we conducted two sets of experiments on the Torch7 and Theano frameworks. On both; BNNs achieved nearly state-of-the-art results over the MNIST; CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. We also report our preliminary results on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Last but not least; we wrote a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST BNN 7 times faster  than with an unoptimized GPU kernel; without suffering any loss in classification accuracy. The code for training and running our BNNs is available on-line.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6573-binarized-neural-networks/bibtex,Itay Hubara; Matthieu Courbariaux; Daniel Soudry; Ran El-Yaniv; Yoshua Bengio
2016,Bayesian Optimization with Robust Bayesian Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6117-bayesian-optimization-with-robust-bayesian-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6117-bayesian-optimization-with-robust-bayesian-neural-networks,Bayesian optimization is a prominent method for optimizing expensive to evaluate black-box functions that is prominently applied to tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms. Despite its successes; the prototypical Bayesian optimization approach - using Gaussian process models - does not scale well to either many hyperparameters or many function evaluations. Attacking this lack of scalability and flexibility is thus one of the key challenges of the field. We present a general approach for using flexible parametric models (neural networks) for Bayesian optimization; staying as close to a truly Bayesian treatment as possible. We obtain scalability through stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; whose robustness we improve via a scale adaptation. Experiments including multi-task Bayesian optimization with 21 tasks; parallel optimization of deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning show the power and flexibility of this approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6117-bayesian-optimization-with-robust-bayesian-neural-networks/bibtex,Jost Tobias Springenberg; Aaron Klein; Stefan Falkner; Frank Hutter

Our approach uses dynamic programming to balance a trade-off between caching of intermediate results and recomputation. The algorithm is capable of tightly fitting within almost any user-set memory budget while finding an optimal execution policy minimizing the computational cost. Computational devices have limited memory capacity and maximizing a computational performance given a fixed memory budget is a practical use-case. We provide asymptotic computational upper bounds for various regimes. The algorithm is particularly effective for long sequences. For sequences of length 1000; our algorithm saves 95\% of memory usage while using only one third more time per iteration than the standard BPTT.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6221-memory-efficient-backpropagation-through-time/bibtex,Audrunas Gruslys; Remi Munos; Ivo Danihelka; Marc Lanctot; Alex Graves

Our first main result shows that the population likelihood function has bad local maxima even in the special case of equally-weighted mixtures of well-separated and spherical Gaussians. We prove that the log-likelihood value of these bad local maxima can be arbitrarily worse than that of any global optimum; thereby resolving an open question of Srebro (2007). Our second main result shows that the EM algorithm (or a first-order variant of it) with random initialization will converge to bad critical points with probability at least $1-e^{-\Omega(M)}$. We further establish that a first-order variant of EM will not converge to strict saddle points almost surely; indicating that the poor performance of the first-order method can be attributed to the existence of bad local maxima rather than bad saddle points. Overall; our results highlight the necessity of careful initialization when using the EM algorithm in practice; even when applied in highly favorable settings.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6324-local-maxima-in-the-likelihood-of-gaussian-mixture-models-structural-results-and-algorithmic-consequences/bibtex,Chi Jin; Yuchen Zhang; Sivaraman Balakrishnan; Martin J.

2016,Learnable Visual Markers,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6323-learnable-visual-markers.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6323-learnable-visual-markers,We propose a new approach to designing visual markers (analogous to QR-codes; markers for augmented reality; and robotic fiducial tags) based on the advances in deep generative networks. In our approach; the markers are obtained as color images synthesized by a deep network from input bit strings; whereas another deep network is trained to recover the bit strings back from the photos of these markers. The two networks are trained simultaneously in a joint backpropagation process that takes characteristic photometric and geometric distortions associated with marker fabrication and capture into account. Additionally; a stylization loss based on statistics of activations in a pretrained classification network can be inserted into the learning in order to shift the marker appearance towards some texture prototype. In the experiments; we demonstrate that the markers obtained using our approach are capable of retaining bit strings that are long enough to be practical. The ability to automatically adapt markers according to the usage scenario and the desired capacity as well as the ability to combine information encoding with artistic stylization are the unique properties of our approach. As a byproduct; our approach provides an insight on the structure of patterns that are most suitable for recognition by ConvNets and on their ability to distinguish composite patterns.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6323-learnable-visual-markers/bibtex,Oleg Grinchuk; Vadim Lebedev; Victor Lempitsky
2016,Linear Relaxations for Finding Diverse Elements in Metric Spaces,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6500-linear-relaxations-for-finding-diverse-elements-in-metric-spaces.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6500-linear-relaxations-for-finding-diverse-elements-in-metric-spaces,Choosing a diverse subset of a large collection of points in a metric space is a fundamental problem; with applications in feature selection; recommender systems; web search; data summarization; etc. Various notions of diversity have been proposed; tailored to different applications. The general algorithmic goal is to find a subset of points that maximize diversity; while obeying a cardinality (or more generally; matroid) constraint.  The goal of this paper is to develop a novel linear programming (LP) framework that allows us to design approximation algorithms for such problems. We study an objective known as {\em sum-min} diversity; which is known to be effective in many applications; and give the first constant factor approximation algorithm. Our LP framework allows us to easily incorporate additional constraints; as well as secondary objectives. We also prove a hardness result for two natural diversity objectives; under the  so-called {\em planted clique} assumption. Finally; we study the empirical performance of our algorithm on several standard datasets. We first study the approximation quality of the algorithm by comparing with the LP objective. Then; we compare the quality of the solutions produced by our method with other popular diversity maximization algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6500-linear-relaxations-for-finding-diverse-elements-in-metric-spaces/bibtex,Aditya Bhaskara; Mehrdad Ghadiri; Vahab Mirrokni; Ola Svensson
2016,Agnostic Estimation for Misspecified Phase Retrieval Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6094-agnostic-estimation-for-misspecified-phase-retrieval-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6094-agnostic-estimation-for-misspecified-phase-retrieval-models,The goal of noisy high-dimensional phase retrieval is to estimate an $s$-sparse parameter $\boldsymbol{\beta}^*\in \mathbb{R}^d$ from $n$ realizations of the model $Y = (\boldsymbol{X}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}^*)^2 + \varepsilon$. Based on this model; we propose a significant semi-parametric generalization called misspecified phase retrieval (MPR); in which $Y = f(\boldsymbol{X}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta}^*; \varepsilon)$ with unknown $f$ and $\operatorname{Cov}(Y; (\boldsymbol{X}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\beta}^*)^2) > 0$. For example; MPR encompasses $Y = h(|\boldsymbol{X}^{\top} \boldsymbol{\beta}^*|) + \varepsilon$ with increasing $h$ as a special case. Despite the generality of the MPR model; it eludes the reach of most existing semi-parametric estimators. In this paper; we propose an estimation procedure; which consists of solving a cascade of two convex programs and provably recovers the direction of $\boldsymbol{\beta}^*$. Our theory is backed up by thorough numerical results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6094-agnostic-estimation-for-misspecified-phase-retrieval-models/bibtex,Matey Neykov; Zhaoran Wang; Han Liu
2016,Coresets for Scalable Bayesian Logistic Regression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6486-coresets-for-scalable-bayesian-logistic-regression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6486-coresets-for-scalable-bayesian-logistic-regression,The use of Bayesian methods in large-scale data settings is attractive because of the rich hierarchical models; uncertainty quantification; and prior specification they provide. Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are computationally expensive; however; making their direct application to large datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to; for example; use only a random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without modification. In this paper; we develop an efficient coreset construction algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for fixed; known datasets; and in expectation for a wide class of data generative models. Crucially; the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings; with minimal additional effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets; and find that; in practice; the size of the coreset is independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore; constructing the coreset takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6486-coresets-for-scalable-bayesian-logistic-regression/bibtex,Jonathan Huggins; Trevor Campbell; Tamara Broderick
2016,A Sparse Interactive Model for Matrix Completion with Side Information,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6265-a-sparse-interactive-model-for-matrix-completion-with-side-information.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6265-a-sparse-interactive-model-for-matrix-completion-with-side-information,Matrix completion methods can benefit from side information besides the partially observed matrix. The use of side features describing the row and column entities of a matrix has been shown to reduce the sample complexity for completing the matrix. We propose a novel sparse formulation that explicitly models the interaction between the row and column side features to approximate the matrix entries. Unlike early methods; this model does not require the low-rank condition on the model parameter matrix. We prove that when the side features can span the latent feature space of the matrix to be recovered; the number of observed entries needed for an exact recovery is $O(\log N)$ where $N$ is the size of the matrix. When the side features are corrupted latent features of the matrix with a small perturbation; our method can achieve an $\epsilon$-recovery with $O(\log N)$ sample complexity; and maintains a $\O(N^{3/2})$ rate similar to classfic methods with no side information. An efficient linearized Lagrangian algorithm is developed with a strong guarantee of convergence. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art methods both in simulations and on real world datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6265-a-sparse-interactive-model-for-matrix-completion-with-side-information/bibtex,Jin Lu; Guannan Liang; Jiangwen Sun; Jinbo Bi
2016,Adaptive Newton Method for Empirical Risk Minimization to Statistical Accuracy,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6262-adaptive-newton-method-for-empirical-risk-minimization-to-statistical-accuracy.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6262-adaptive-newton-method-for-empirical-risk-minimization-to-statistical-accuracy,We consider empirical risk minimization for large-scale datasets. We introduce Ada Newton as an adaptive algorithm that uses Newton's method with adaptive sample sizes. The main idea of Ada Newton is to increase the size of the training set by a factor larger than one in a way that the minimization variable for the current training set is in the local neighborhood of the optimal argument of the next training set. This allows to exploit the quadratic convergence property of Newton's method and reach the statistical accuracy of each training set with only one iteration of Newton's method. We show theoretically that we can iteratively increase the sample size while applying single Newton iterations without line search and staying within the statistical accuracy of the regularized empirical risk. In particular; we can double the size of the training set in each iteration when the number of samples is sufficiently large. Numerical experiments on various datasets confirm the possibility of increasing the sample size by factor 2 at each iteration which implies that Ada Newton achieves the statistical accuracy of the full training set with about two passes over the dataset.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6262-adaptive-newton-method-for-empirical-risk-minimization-to-statistical-accuracy/bibtex,Aryan Mokhtari; Hadi Daneshmand; Aurelien Lucchi; Thomas Hofmann; Alejandro Ribeiro

Instead; these methods use supervised learning to train the policy to mimic a ?teacher? algorithm; such as a trajectory optimizer or a trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. Guided policy search methods provide asymptotic local convergence guarantees by construction; but it is not clear how much the policy improves within a small; finite number of iterations. We show that guided policy search algorithms can be interpreted as an approximate variant of mirror descent; where the projection onto the constraint manifold is not exact. We derive a new guided policy search algorithm that is simpler and provides appealing improvement and convergence guarantees in simplified convex and linear settings; and show that in the more general nonlinear setting; the error in the projection step can be bounded. We provide empirical results on several simulated robotic manipulation tasks that show that our method is stable and achieves similar or better performance when compared to prior guided policy search methods; with a simpler formulation and fewer hyperparameters.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6105-guided-policy-search-via-approximate-mirror-descent/bibtex,William H.

Common dithering strategies for exploration; such as epsilon-greedy; do not carry out temporally-extended (or deep) exploration; this can lead to exponentially larger data requirements. However; most algorithms for statistically efficient RL are not computationally tractable in complex environments. Randomized value functions offer a promising approach to efficient exploration with generalization; but existing algorithms are not compatible with nonlinearly parameterized value functions. As a first step towards addressing such contexts we develop bootstrapped DQN. We demonstrate that bootstrapped DQN can combine deep exploration with deep neural networks for exponentially faster learning than any dithering strategy. In the Arcade Learning Environment bootstrapped DQN substantially improves learning speed and cumulative performance across most games.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6501-deep-exploration-via-bootstrapped-dqn/bibtex,Ian Osband; Charles Blundell; Alexander Pritzel; Benjamin Van Roy

We propose a scalable inference and learning algorithm for FHMMs that draws on ideas from the stochastic variational inference; neural network and copula literatures. Unlike existing approaches; the proposed algorithm requires no message passing procedure among latent variables and can be distributed to a network of computers to speed up learning. Our experiments corroborate that the proposed algorithm does not introduce further approximation bias compared to the proven structured mean-field algorithm; and achieves better performance with long sequences and large FHMMs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6534-scaling-factorial-hidden-markov-models-stochastic-variational-inference-without-messages/bibtex,Yin Cheng Ng; Pawel M.

In numerous applications; the function optimized is not known a priori; but instead learned from data. What are the guarantees we have when optimizing functions from sampled data?  In this paper we show that for any monotone submodular function with curvature c there is a (1 - c)/(1 + c - c^2) approximation algorithm for maximization under cardinality constraints when polynomially-many samples are drawn from the uniform distribution over feasible sets. Moreover; we show that this algorithm is optimal. That is; for any c < 1; there exists a submodular function with curvature c for which no algorithm can achieve a better approximation. The curvature assumption is crucial as for general monotone submodular functions no algorithm can obtain a constant-factor approximation for maximization under a cardinality constraint when observing polynomially-many samples drawn from any distribution over feasible sets; even when the function is statistically learnable.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6447-the-power-of-optimization-from-samples/bibtex,Eric Balkanski; Aviad Rubinstein; Yaron Singer
2016,A Multi-step Inertial Forward-Backward Splitting Method for Non-convex Optimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6285-a-multi-step-inertial-forward-backward-splitting-method-for-non-convex-optimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6285-a-multi-step-inertial-forward-backward-splitting-method-for-non-convex-optimization,In this paper; we propose a multi-step inertial Forward--Backward splitting algorithm for minimizing the sum of two non-necessarily convex functions; one of which is proper lower semi-continuous while the other is differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient. We first prove global convergence of the scheme with the help of the Kurdyka??ojasiewicz property. Then; when the non-smooth part is also partly smooth relative to a smooth submanifold; we establish finite identification of the latter and provide sharp local linear convergence analysis. The proposed method is illustrated on a few problems arising from statistics and machine learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6285-a-multi-step-inertial-forward-backward-splitting-method-for-non-convex-optimization/bibtex,Jingwei Liang; Jalal Fadili; Gabriel Peyr?
2016,Convolutional Neural Fabrics,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6304-convolutional-neural-fabrics.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6304-convolutional-neural-fabrics,Despite the success of CNNs; selecting the optimal architecture for a given task remains an open problem. Instead of aiming to select a single optimal architecture; we propose a ``fabric'' that embeds an exponentially large number of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response maps at different layers; scales; and channels  with a sparse homogeneous local connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths; the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together; sharing their weights where their  paths overlap. Parameters can be learned using standard methods based on back-propagation; at a cost that scales linearly in the fabric size. We present benchmark results competitive with the state of the art for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR10; and for semantic segmentation on the Part Labels dataset.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6304-convolutional-neural-fabrics/bibtex,Shreyas Saxena; Jakob Verbeek
2016,Quantum Perceptron Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6401-quantum-perceptron-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6401-quantum-perceptron-models,We demonstrate how quantum computation can provide non-trivial improvements in the computational and statistical complexity of the perceptron model. We develop two quantum algorithms for perceptron learning. The first algorithm exploits quantum information processing to determine a separating hyperplane using a number of steps sublinear in the number of data points $N$; namely $O(\sqrt{N})$. The second algorithm illustrates how the classical mistake bound of $O(\frac{1}{\gamma^2})$ can be further improved to $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}})$ through quantum means; where $\gamma$ denotes the margin. Such improvements are achieved through the application of quantum amplitude amplification to the version space interpretation of the perceptron model.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6401-quantum-perceptron-models/bibtex,Ashish Kapoor; Nathan Wiebe; Krysta Svore

We show that layering a dynamical systems prior over temporal evolution of weights of a kernel model is a valid approach to spatiotemporal modeling that does not necessarily require the design of complex nonstationary kernels. Furthermore; we show that such a predictive model can be utilized to determine sensing locations that guarantee that the hidden state of the phenomena can be recovered with very few measurements. We provide sufficient conditions on the number and spatial location of samples required to guarantee state recovery; and provide a lower bound on the minimum number of samples required to robustly infer the hidden states. Our approach outperforms existing methods in numerical experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6189-kernel-observers-systems-theoretic-modeling-and-inference-of-spatiotemporally-evolving-processes/bibtex,Hassan A.

We introduce a new parameter $\W$; which measures the total statistical variance of the loss distributions over $T$ rounds of the process; and study how this amount affects the regret. We investigate the interaction between $\W$ and $\Gamma$; which counts the number of times the distributions change; as well as $\W$ and $V$; which measures how far the distributions deviates over time. One striking result we find is that even when $\Gamma$; $V$; and $\Lambda$ are all restricted to constant; the regret lower bound in the bandit setting still grows with $T$. The other highlight is that in the full-information setting; a constant regret becomes achievable with constant $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$; as it can be made independent of $T$; while with constant $V$ and $\Lambda$; the regret still has a $T^{1/3}$ dependency. We not only propose algorithms with upper bound guarantee; but prove their matching lower bounds as well.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6536-tracking-the-best-expert-in-non-stationary-stochastic-environments/bibtex,Chen-Yu Wei; Yi-Te Hong; Chi-Jen Lu

In spite of this; optimization algorithms are still designed by hand. In this paper we show how the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem; allowing the algorithm to learn to exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way. Our learned algorithms; implemented by LSTMs; outperform generic; hand-designed competitors on the tasks for which they are trained; and also generalize well to new tasks with similar structure. We demonstrate this on a number of tasks; including simple convex problems; training neural networks; and styling images with neural art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6461-learning-to-learn-by-gradient-descent-by-gradient-descent/bibtex,Marcin Andrychowicz; Misha Denil; Sergio G?mez; Matthew W.

These discretized operators usually depend on bandwidth parameters whose tuning remains a theoretical and practical problem. In this paper; we address this problem for the unormalized graph Laplacian by establishing an oracle inequality that opens the door to a well-founded data-driven procedure for the bandwidth selection. Our approach relies on recent results by Lacour and Massart (2015) on the so-called Lepski's method.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6210-data-driven-estimation-of-laplace-beltrami-operator/bibtex,Frederic Chazal; Ilaria Giulini; Bertrand Michel

In particular; we consider a recently proposed arithmetic circuit representation; the Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD).  We show that PSDD supports a polytime multiplication operator; while they do not support a polytime operator for summing-out variables.  A polytime multiplication operator make PSDDs suitable for a broader class of applications compared to arithmetic circuits; which do not in general support multiplication.  As one example; we show that PSDD multiplication leads to a very simple but effective compilation algorithm for probabilistic graphical models: represent each model factor as a PSDD; and then multiply them.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6363-tractable-operations-for-arithmetic-circuits-of-probabilistic-models/bibtex,Yujia Shen; Arthur Choi; Adnan Darwiche
2016,Select-and-Sample for Spike-and-Slab Sparse Coding,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6276-select-and-sample-for-spike-and-slab-sparse-coding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6276-select-and-sample-for-spike-and-slab-sparse-coding,Probabilistic inference serves as a popular model for neural processing. It is still unclear; however; how approximate probabilistic inference can be accurate and scalable to very high-dimensional continuous latent spaces. Especially as typical posteriors for sensory data can be expected to exhibit complex latent dependencies including multiple modes. Here; we study an approach that can efficiently be scaled while maintaining a richly structured posterior approximation under these conditions. As example model we use spike-and-slab sparse coding for V1 processing; and combine latent subspace selection with Gibbs sampling (select-and-sample). Unlike factored variational approaches; the method can maintain large numbers of posterior modes and complex latent dependencies. Unlike pure sampling; the method is scalable to very high-dimensional latent spaces. Among all sparse coding approaches with non-trivial posterior approximations (MAP or ICA-like models); we report the largest-scale results. In applications we firstly verify the approach by showing competitiveness in standard denoising benchmarks. Secondly; we use its scalability to; for the first time; study highly-overcomplete settings for V1 encoding using sophisticated posterior representations. More generally; our study shows that very accurate probabilistic inference for multi-modal posteriors with complex dependencies is tractable; functionally desirable and consistent with models for neural inference.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6276-select-and-sample-for-spike-and-slab-sparse-coding/bibtex,Abdul-Saboor Sheikh; J?rg L?cke

The problem has hardly been discussed previously due to the complexity of patterns in urban environments;  which have both spatial and temporal dependencies. We address the problem  as learning a kernel classifier on an efficient feature space. The key novelty of  our approach is the incorporation of variations in the time domain into the spatial  domain. We propose a method to propagate motion uncertainty into the kernel using a hierarchical model. The main benefit of this approach is that it can directly predict  the occupancy state of the map in the future from past observations; being a valuable  tool for robot trajectory planning under uncertainty. Our approach preserves the  main computational benefits of static Hilbert maps ? using stochastic gradient  descent for fast optimization of model parameters and incremental updates as  new data are captured. Experiments conducted in road intersections of an urban  environment demonstrated that spatio-temporal Hilbert maps can accurately model  changes in the map while outperforming other techniques on various aspects.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6541-spatio-temporal-hilbert-maps-for-continuous-occupancy-representation-in-dynamic-environments/bibtex,Ransalu Senanayake; Lionel Ott; Simon O'Callaghan; Fabio T.

The main goal of the approach is to construct a feature representation for which a set of linear hypotheses is of sufficient capacity -- large enough to contain a satisfactory solution to the considered problem and small enough to allow good generalization from a small number of training examples. We achieve this goal with a greedy procedure that constructs features by empirically fitting squared error residuals. The proposed constructive procedure is consistent and can output a rich set of features. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated empirically by fitting a linear ridge regression model in the constructed feature space and our empirical results indicate a superior performance of our approach over competing methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6557-greedy-feature-construction/bibtex,Dino Oglic; Thomas G?rtner

On each trial we predict a matrix entry and then receive the true entry. We propose a Matrix Exponentiated Gradient algorithm [1] to solve this problem. We provide a mistake bound for the algorithm; which scales with the margin complexity [2; 3] of the underlying matrix. The bound suggests an interpretation where each row of the matrix is a prediction task over a finite set of objects; the columns. Using this we show that the algorithm makes a number of mistakes which is comparable up to a logarithmic factor to the number of mistakes made by the Kernel Perceptron with an optimal kernel in hindsight. We discuss applications of the algorithm to predicting as well as the best biclustering and to the problem of predicting the labeling of a graph without knowing the graph in advance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6567-mistake-bounds-for-binary-matrix-completion/bibtex,Mark Herbster; Stephen Pasteris; Massimiliano Pontil

We propose a formal definition of the value alignment problem as cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a cooperative; partial- information game with two agents; human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human?s reward function; but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL; where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation; optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching; active learning; and communicative actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP; prove that optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL; and derive an approximate CIRL algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6420-cooperative-inverse-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Dylan Hadfield-Menell; Stuart J.

In many cases; the correlation exists between not only events' emitted observations; but also their arrival times. State space models (e.g.; hidden Markov model) and stochastic interaction point process models (e.g.; Hawkes process) have been studied extensively yet separately for the two types of correlations in the past. In this paper; we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach that considers both types of correlations via unifying and generalizing hidden semi-Markov model and interaction point process model. The proposed approach can simultaneously model both the observations and arrival times of temporal events; and determine the number of latent states from data. A Metropolis-within-particle-Gibbs sampler with ancestor resampling is developed for efficient posterior inference. The approach is tested on both synthetic and real-world data with promising outcomes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6243-infinite-hidden-semi-markov-modulated-interaction-point-process/bibtex,matt zhang; Peng Lin; Peng Lin; Ting Guo; Yang Wang; Yang Wang; Fang Chen

Using the median of means allows us to significantly reduce the dependence of our bounds on the range of values that the value function can take; while introducing a dependence on the (potentially much smaller) variance of the Bellman operator. Additionally; our algorithm is the first algorithm with PAC bounds that can be applied to MDPs with unbounded rewards.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6577-improving-pac-exploration-using-the-median-of-means/bibtex,Jason Pazis; Ronald E.

Current RNN models are ill suited to process irregularly sampled data triggered by events generated in continuous time by sensors or other neurons. Such data can occur; for example; when the input comes from novel event-driven artificial sensors which generate sparse; asynchronous streams of events or from multiple conventional sensors with different update intervals. In this work; we introduce the Phased LSTM model; which extends the LSTM unit by adding a new time gate. This gate is controlled by a parametrized oscillation with a frequency range which require updates of the memory cell only during a small percentage of the cycle. Even with the sparse updates imposed by the oscillation; the Phased LSTM network achieves faster convergence than regular LSTMs on tasks which require learning of long sequences.   The model naturally integrates inputs from sensors of arbitrary sampling rates; thereby opening new areas of investigation for processing asynchronous sensory events that carry timing information.  It also greatly improves the performance of LSTMs in standard RNN applications; and does so with an order-of-magnitude fewer computes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6310-phased-lstm-accelerating-recurrent-network-training-for-long-or-event-based-sequences/bibtex,Daniel Neil; Michael Pfeiffer; Shih-Chii Liu

2016,Large-Scale Price Optimization via Network Flow,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6301-large-scale-price-optimization-via-network-flow.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6301-large-scale-price-optimization-via-network-flow,This paper deals with price optimization; which is to find the best pricing strategy that maximizes revenue or profit; on the basis of demand forecasting models. Though recent advances in regression technologies have made it possible to reveal price-demand relationship of a number of multiple products; most existing price optimization methods; such as mixed integer programming formulation; cannot handle tens or hundreds of products because of their high computational costs. To cope with this problem; this paper proposes a novel approach based on network flow algorithms. We reveal a connection between supermodularity of the revenue and cross elasticity of demand. On the basis of this connection; we propose an efficient algorithm that employs network flow algorithms. The proposed algorithm can handle hundreds or thousands of products; and returns an exact optimal solution under an assumption regarding cross elasticity of demand. Even in case in which the assumption does not hold; the proposed algorithm can efficiently find approximate solutions as good as can other state-of-the-art methods; as empirical results show.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6301-large-scale-price-optimization-via-network-flow/bibtex,Shinji Ito; Ryohei Fujimaki

It is of high interest in compressed sensing and statistical learning. This property is particularly important for computationally efficient recovery methods. As a consequence; even though it is in general NP-hard to check that RIP holds; there have been substantial efforts to find tractable proxies for it.  These would allow the construction of RIP matrices and the polynomial-time verification of RIP given an arbitrary matrix. We consider the framework of average-case certifiers; that never wrongly declare that a matrix is RIP; while being often correct for random instances. While there are such functions which are tractable in a suboptimal parameter regime; we show that this is a computationally hard task in any better regime.  Our results are based on a new; weaker assumption on the problem of detecting dense subgraphs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6132-average-case-hardness-of-rip-certification/bibtex,Tengyao Wang; Quentin Berthet; Yaniv Plan

To a great extent; our highly-skilled motor responses are a result of a reactive feedback system; originating in the brain-stem and spinal cord; combined with a feed-forward anticipatory system; that is adaptively fine-tuned by sensory experience and originates in the cerebellum. Based on that interaction we design the counterfactual predictive control (CFPC) architecture; an anticipatory adaptive motor control scheme in which a feed-forward module; based on the cerebellum; steers an error feedback controller with counterfactual error signals. Those are signals that trigger reactions as actual errors would; but that do not code for any current of forthcoming errors. In order to determine the optimal learning strategy; we derive a novel learning rule for the feed-forward module that involves an eligibility trace and operates at the synaptic level. In particular; our eligibility trace provides a mechanism beyond co-incidence detection in that it convolves a history of prior synaptic inputs with error signals. In the context of cerebellar physiology; this solution implies that Purkinje cell synapses should generate eligibility traces using a forward model of the system being controlled. From an engineering perspective; CFPC provides a general-purpose anticipatory control architecture equipped with a learning rule that exploits the full dynamics of the closed-loop system.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6151-a-forward-model-at-purkinje-cell-synapses-facilitates-cerebellar-anticipatory-control/bibtex,Ivan Herreros; Xerxes Arsiwalla; Paul Verschure

However; PLANET; the standard distributed tree learning algorithm implemented in systems such as \xgboost and Spark MLlib; scales poorly as data dimensionality and tree depths grow.  We present Yggdrasil; a new distributed tree learning method that outperforms existing methods by up to 24x.  Unlike PLANET; Yggdrasil is based on vertical partitioning of the data (i.e.; partitioning by feature); along with a set of optimized data structures to reduce the CPU and communication costs of training. Yggdrasil (1) trains directly on compressed data for compressible features and labels; (2) introduces efficient data structures for training on uncompressed data; and (3) minimizes communication between nodes by using sparse bitvectors.  Moreover; while PLANET approximates split points through feature binning; Yggdrasil does not require binning; and we analytically characterize the impact of this approximation. We evaluate Yggdrasil against the MNIST 8M dataset and a high-dimensional dataset at Yahoo; for both; Yggdrasil is faster by up to an order of magnitude.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6366-yggdrasil-an-optimized-system-for-training-deep-decision-trees-at-scale/bibtex,Firas Abuzaid; Joseph K.

GRAB takes as input a data matrix of p variables and n samples; and jointly learns both a network among p variables and densely connected groups of variables (called `blocks'). GRAB has four major novelties as compared to existing network estimation methods: 1) It does not require the blocks to be given a priori. 2) Blocks can overlap. 3) It can jointly learn a network structure and overlapping blocks. 4) It solves a joint optimization problem with the block coordinate descent method that is convex in each step. We show that GRAB reveals the underlying network structure substantially better than four state-of-the-art competitors on synthetic data. When applied to cancer gene expression data; GRAB outperforms its competitors in revealing known functional gene sets and potentially novel genes that drive cancer.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6097-learning-sparse-gaussian-graphical-models-with-overlapping-blocks/bibtex,Mohammad Javad Hosseini; Su-In Lee
2016,CliqueCNN: Deep Unsupervised Exemplar Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6387-cliquecnn-deep-unsupervised-exemplar-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6387-cliquecnn-deep-unsupervised-exemplar-learning,Exemplar learning is a powerful paradigm for discovering visual similarities in an unsupervised manner. In this context; however; the recent breakthrough in deep learning could not yet unfold its full potential. With only a single positive sample; a great imbalance between one positive and many negatives; and unreliable relationships between most samples; training of convolutional neural networks is impaired. Given weak estimates of local distance we propose a single optimization problem to extract batches of samples with mutually consistent relations. Conflicting relations are distributed over different batches and similar samples are grouped into compact cliques. Learning exemplar similarities is framed as a sequence of clique categorization tasks.

Tensor modeling has been widely used for capturing the higher order relations between  multimodal data sources. In addition to a linear model;  a nonlinear tensor model has been received much attention recently because of its high flexibility. We consider  an alternating minimization procedure for  a general nonlinear model where the true function  consists of components in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In this paper; we show that the alternating minimization method achieves linear convergence as an optimization algorithm  and that the generalization error of the resultant estimator yields the minimax optimality. We apply our algorithm to some multitask learning problems and show that the method actually shows favorable performances.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6419-minimax-optimal-alternating-minimization-for-kernel-nonparametric-tensor-learning/bibtex,Taiji Suzuki; Heishiro Kanagawa; Hayato Kobayashi; Nobuyuki Shimizu; Yukihiro Tagami

The latter is defined by the basic subproblem of modeling the conditional mean of one variable as a sparse function of all others.  Our approach models a set of conditional quantiles of one variable as a sparse function of all others; and hence offers a much richer; more expressive class of conditional distribution estimates.  We establish that; under suitable regularity conditions; the MQGM identifies the exact conditional independencies with probability tending to one as the problem size grows; even outside of the usual homoskedastic Gaussian data model. We develop an efficient algorithm for fitting the MQGM using the alternating direction method of multipliers.  We also describe a strategy for sampling from the joint distribution that underlies the MQGM estimate. Lastly; we present detailed experiments that demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the MQGM in modeling hetereoskedastic non-Gaussian data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6092-the-multiple-quantile-graphical-model/bibtex,Alnur Ali; J.

2016,Can Active Memory Replace Attention?,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6295-can-active-memory-replace-attention.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6295-can-active-memory-replace-attention,Several mechanisms to focus attention of a neural network on selected parts of its input or memory have been used successfully in deep learning models in recent years. Attention has improved image classification; image captioning; speech recognition; generative models; and learning algorithmic tasks; but it had probably the largest impact on neural machine translation.  Recently; similar improvements have been obtained using  alternative mechanisms that do not focus on a single part of a memory but operate on all of it in parallel; in a uniform way. Such mechanism; which we call active memory; improved over attention in algorithmic tasks; image processing; and in generative modelling.  So far; however; active memory has not improved over attention for most natural language processing tasks; in particular for machine translation. We analyze this shortcoming in this paper and propose an extended model of active memory that matches existing attention models on neural machine translation and generalizes better to longer sentences. We investigate this model and explain why previous active memory models did not succeed. Finally; we discuss when active memory brings most benefits and where attention can be a better choice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6295-can-active-memory-replace-attention/bibtex,?ukasz Kaiser; Samy Bengio

However; it is unknown how animals learn these decision thresholds. We examine threshold learning by constructing a reward function that averages over many trials to Wald's cost function that defines decision optimality. These rewards are highly stochastic and hence challenging to optimize; which we address in two ways: first; a simple two-factor reward-modulated learning rule derived from Williams' REINFORCE method for neural networks; and second; Bayesian optimization of the reward function with a Gaussian process. Bayesian optimization converges in fewer trials than REINFORCE but is slower computationally with greater variance. The REINFORCE method is also a better model of acquisition behaviour in animals and a similar learning rule has been proposed for modelling basal ganglia function.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6494-threshold-learning-for-optimal-decision-making/bibtex,Nathan F.

Here; we first propose a new intuitive principle of unsupervised deep learning from time series which uses the nonstationary structure of the data. Our learning principle; time-contrastive learning (TCL);  finds a representation which allows optimal discrimination of time segments (windows). Surprisingly; we show how TCL can be related to a nonlinear ICA model; when ICA is redefined to include temporal nonstationarities. In particular; we show that TCL combined with linear ICA estimates the nonlinear ICA model up to point-wise transformations of the sources; and this solution is unique --- thus providing the first identifiability result for nonlinear ICA which is rigorous; constructive; as well as very general.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6395-unsupervised-feature-extraction-by-time-contrastive-learning-and-nonlinear-ica/bibtex,Aapo Hyvarinen; Hiroshi Morioka

Taking inspiration from other areas of cognitive science; we propose that this is accomplished by harnessing compositionality: complex structure is decomposed into simpler building blocks. We formalize this idea within the framework of Bayesian regression using a grammar over Gaussian process kernels. We show that participants prefer compositional over non-compositional function extrapolations; that samples from the human prior over functions are best described by a compositional model; and that people perceive compositional functions as more predictable than their non-compositional but otherwise similar counterparts. We argue that the compositional nature of intuitive functions is consistent with broad principles of human cognition.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6130-probing-the-compositionality-of-intuitive-functions/bibtex,Eric Schulz; Josh Tenenbaum; David K.

However deep models with several layers of dependent stochastic variables are difficult to train which limits the improvements obtained using these highly expressive models. We propose a new inference model; the Ladder Variational Autoencoder; that recursively corrects the generative distribution by a data dependent approximate likelihood in a process resembling the recently proposed Ladder Network. We show that this model provides state of the art predictive log-likelihood and tighter log-likelihood lower bound compared to the purely bottom-up inference in layered Variational Autoencoders and other generative models. We provide a detailed analysis of the learned hierarchical latent representation and show that our new inference model is qualitatively different and utilizes a deeper more distributed hierarchy of latent variables. Finally; we observe that batch-normalization and deterministic warm-up (gradually turning on the KL-term) are crucial for training variational models with many stochastic layers.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6275-ladder-variational-autoencoders/bibtex,Casper Kaae S?nderby; Tapani Raiko; Lars Maal?e; S?ren Kaae S?nderby; Ole Winther
2016,Communication-Optimal Distributed Clustering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6562-communication-optimal-distributed-clustering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6562-communication-optimal-distributed-clustering,Clustering large datasets is a fundamental problem with a number of applications in machine learning. Data is often collected on different sites and clustering needs to be performed in a distributed manner with low communication. We would like the quality of the clustering in the distributed setting to match that in the centralized setting for which all the data resides on a single site. In this work; we study both graph and geometric clustering problems in two distributed models: (1) a point-to-point model; and (2) a model with a broadcast channel. We give protocols in both models which we show are nearly optimal by proving almost matching communication lower bounds. Our work highlights the surprising power of a broadcast channel for clustering problems; roughly speaking; to cluster n points or n vertices in a graph distributed across s servers; for a worst-case partitioning the communication complexity in a point-to-point model is n*s; while in the broadcast model it is n + s. We implement our algorithms and demonstrate this phenomenon on real life datasets; showing that our algorithms are also very efficient in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6562-communication-optimal-distributed-clustering/bibtex,Jiecao Chen; He Sun; David Woodruff; Qin Zhang

Parameters of the model are usually learned by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from training samples to the learned model. We propose in this work a novel approach for Boltzmann machine training which assumes that a meaningful metric between observations is known. This metric between observations can then be used to define the Wasserstein distance between the distribution induced by the Boltzmann machine on the one hand; and that given by the training sample on the other hand. We derive a gradient of that distance with respect to the model parameters. Minimization of this new objective leads to generative models with different statistical properties. We demonstrate their practical potential on data completion and denoising; for which the metric between observations plays a crucial role.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6248-wasserstein-training-of-restricted-boltzmann-machines/bibtex,Gr?goire Montavon; Klaus-Robert M?ller; Marco Cuturi

The proposed methodology leverages kernel-based multi-task learning to curb the embarrassing phenomenon of quantile crossing; with a one-step estimation procedure and no post-processing. Moreover; this framework comes along with theoretical guarantees and an efficient coordinate descent learning algorithm. Numerical experiments on benchmark and real datasets highlight the enhancements of our approach regarding the prediction error; the crossing occurrences and the training time.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6239-joint-quantile-regression-in-vector-valued-rkhss/bibtex,Maxime Sangnier; Olivier Fercoq; Florence d'Alch?-Buc

In this paper; we consider general superposition models which allow sum of any number of component parameters; and each component structure can be characterized by any norm. We present a simple estimator for such models; give a geometric condition under which the components can be accurately estimated; characterize sample complexity of the estimator; and give non-asymptotic bounds on the componentwise estimation error. We use tools from empirical processes and generic chaining for the statistical analysis; and our results; which substantially generalize prior work on superposition models; are in terms of Gaussian widths of suitable spherical caps.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6079-high-dimensional-structured-superposition-models/bibtex,Qilong Gu; Arindam Banerjee
2016,Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning: Integrating Temporal Abstraction and Intrinsic Motivation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6233-hierarchical-deep-reinforcement-learning-integrating-temporal-abstraction-and-intrinsic-motivation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6233-hierarchical-deep-reinforcement-learning-integrating-temporal-abstraction-and-intrinsic-motivation,Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. One of the key difficulties is insufficient exploration; resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust policies. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for their own sake rather than to directly solve external goals. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN); a framework to integrate hierarchical action-value functions; operating at different temporal scales; with goal-driven intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level q-value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals; while a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications; such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse and delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process with stochastic transitions; and (2) the classic ATARI game -- `Montezuma's Revenge'.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6233-hierarchical-deep-reinforcement-learning-integrating-temporal-abstraction-and-intrinsic-motivation/bibtex,Tejas D.

2016,MetaGrad: Multiple Learning Rates in Online Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6268-metagrad-multiple-learning-rates-in-online-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6268-metagrad-multiple-learning-rates-in-online-learning,In online convex optimization it is well known that certain subclasses of objective functions are much easier than arbitrary convex functions. We are interested in designing adaptive methods that can automatically get fast rates in as many such subclasses as possible; without any manual tuning. Previous adaptive methods are able to interpolate between strongly convex and general convex functions. We present a new method; MetaGrad; that adapts to a much broader class of functions; including exp-concave and strongly convex functions; but also various types of stochastic and non-stochastic functions without any curvature. For instance; MetaGrad can achieve logarithmic regret on the unregularized hinge loss; even though it has no curvature; if the data come from a favourable probability distribution. MetaGrad's main feature is that it simultaneously considers multiple learning rates. Unlike all previous methods with provable regret guarantees; however; its learning rates are not monotonically decreasing over time and are not tuned based on a theoretically derived bound on the regret. Instead; they are weighted directly proportional to their empirical performance on the data using a tilted exponential weights master algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6268-metagrad-multiple-learning-rates-in-online-learning/bibtex,Tim van Erven; Wouter M.

We do not need to assume that the optimal predictor is the same between train and test; or that the true distribution lies in any parametric family. We can also efficiently compute gradients of the estimated error and hence perform unsupervised discriminative learning. Our technical tool is the method of moments; which allows us to exploit conditional independencies in the absence of a fully-specified model. Our framework encompasses a large family of losses including the log and exponential loss; and extends to structured output settings such as conditional random fields.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6201-unsupervised-risk-estimation-using-only-conditional-independence-structure/bibtex,Jacob Steinhardt; Percy S.

For smooth functions; we show that accelerated gradient descent (AGD) and an accelerated variant of SVRG are optimal in the deterministic and randomized settings respectively; and that a gradient oracle is sufficient for the optimal rate. For non-smooth functions; having access to prox oracles reduces the complexity and we present optimal methods based on smoothing that improve over methods using just gradient accesses.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6058-tight-complexity-bounds-for-optimizing-composite-objectives/bibtex,Blake E.

2016,Graphical Time Warping for Joint Alignment of Multiple Curves,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6269-graphical-time-warping-for-joint-alignment-of-multiple-curves.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6269-graphical-time-warping-for-joint-alignment-of-multiple-curves,Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a fundamental technique in time series analysis for comparing one curve to another using a flexible time-warping function. However; it was designed to compare a single pair of curves. In many applications; such as in metabolomics and image series analysis; alignment is simultaneously needed for multiple pairs. Because the underlying warping functions are often related; independent application of DTW to each pair is a sub-optimal solution. Yet; it is largely unknown how to efficiently conduct a joint alignment with all warping functions simultaneously considered; since any given warping function is constrained by the others and dynamic programming cannot be applied. In this paper; we show that the joint alignment problem can be transformed into a network flow problem and thus can be exactly and efficiently solved by the max flow algorithm; with a guarantee of global optimality. We name the proposed approach graphical time warping (GTW); emphasizing the graphical nature of the solution and that the dependency structure of the warping functions can be represented by a graph. Modifications of DTW; such as windowing and weighting; are readily derivable within GTW. We also discuss optimal tuning of parameters and hyperparameters in GTW. We illustrate the power of GTW using both synthetic data and a real case study of an astrocyte calcium movie.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6269-graphical-time-warping-for-joint-alignment-of-multiple-curves/bibtex,Yizhi Wang; David J.

In this work; we consider a setting where the learner encounters a stream of tasks but is able to retain only limited information from each encountered task; such as a learned predictor. In contrast to most previous works analyzing this scenario; we do not make any distributional assumptions on the task generating process. Instead; we formulate a complexity measure that captures the diversity of the observed tasks. We provide a lifelong learning algorithm with error guarantees for every observed task (rather than on average). We show sample complexity reductions in comparison to solving every task in isolation in terms of our task complexity measure. Further; our algorithmic framework can naturally be viewed as learning a representation from encountered tasks with a neural network.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6095-lifelong-learning-with-weighted-majority-votes/bibtex,Anastasia Pentina; Ruth Urner

Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language; the standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory solution for learning new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work; we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label; obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot; ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 82.2% to 87.8% and from 88% accuracy to 95% accuracy on Omniglot compared to competing approaches. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the same model on language modeling by introducing a one-shot task on the Penn Treebank.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6385-matching-networks-for-one-shot-learning/bibtex,Oriol Vinyals; Charles Blundell; Tim Lillicrap; koray kavukcuoglu; Daan Wierstra

These models appear promising for applications such as language modeling and machine translation. However; they scale poorly in both space and time as the amount of memory grows --- limiting their applicability to real-world domains. Here; we present an end-to-end differentiable memory access scheme; which we call Sparse Access Memory (SAM); that retains the representational power of the original approaches whilst training efficiently with very large memories. We show that SAM achieves asymptotic lower bounds in space and time complexity; and find that an implementation runs $1;\!000\times$ faster and with $3;\!000\times$ less physical memory than non-sparse models. SAM learns with comparable data efficiency to existing models on a range of synthetic tasks and one-shot Omniglot character recognition; and can scale to tasks requiring $100;\!000$s of time steps and memories. As well; we show how our approach can be adapted for models that maintain temporal associations between memories; as with the recently introduced Differentiable Neural Computer.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6298-scaling-memory-augmented-neural-networks-with-sparse-reads-and-writes/bibtex,Jack Rae; Jonathan J.

2016,Dynamic matrix recovery from incomplete observations under an exact low-rank constraint,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6460-dynamic-matrix-recovery-from-incomplete-observations-under-an-exact-low-rank-constraint.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6460-dynamic-matrix-recovery-from-incomplete-observations-under-an-exact-low-rank-constraint,Low-rank matrix factorizations arise in a wide variety of applications -- including recommendation systems; topic models; and source separation; to name just a few.  In these and many other applications; it has been widely noted that by incorporating temporal information and allowing for the possibility of time-varying models; significant improvements are possible in practice. However; despite the reported superior empirical performance of these dynamic models over their static counterparts; there is limited theoretical justification for introducing these more complex models. In this paper we aim to address this gap by studying the problem of recovering a dynamically evolving low-rank matrix from incomplete observations. First; we propose the locally weighted matrix smoothing (LOWEMS) framework as one possible approach to dynamic matrix recovery. We then establish error bounds for LOWEMS in both the {\em matrix sensing} and {\em matrix completion} observation models. Our results quantify the potential benefits of exploiting dynamic constraints both in terms of recovery accuracy and sample complexity. To illustrate these benefits we provide both synthetic and real-world experimental results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6460-dynamic-matrix-recovery-from-incomplete-observations-under-an-exact-low-rank-constraint/bibtex,Liangbei Xu; Mark Davenport

The HTP-style methods have been shown to have strong approximation guarantee and impressive numerical performance in high dimensional statistical learning applications. However; the current theoretical treatment of these methods has traditionally been restricted to the analysis of parameter estimation consistency. It remains an open problem to analyze the support recovery performance (a.k.a.; sparsistency) of this type of methods for recovering the global minimizer of the original NP-hard problem. In this paper; we bridge this gap by showing; for the first time; that exact recovery of the global sparse minimizer is possible for HTP-style methods under restricted strong condition number bounding conditions. We further show that HTP-style methods are able to recover the support of certain relaxed sparse solutions without assuming bounded restricted strong condition number. Numerical results on simulated data confirms our theoretical predictions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6432-exact-recovery-of-hard-thresholding-pursuit/bibtex,Xiaotong Yuan; Ping Li; Tong Zhang
2016,Data Programming: Creating Large Training Sets; Quickly,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly,Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervised learning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some applications; creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and expensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm for the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which users provide a set of labeling functions; which are programs that heuristically label subsets of the data; but that are noisy and may conflict. By viewing these labeling functions as implicitly describing a generative model for this noise; we show that we can recover the parameters of this model to "denoise" the generated training set; and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of these generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a discriminative loss function to make it noise-aware; and demonstrate our method over a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs. Experimentally; on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge; we show that data programming would have led to a new winning score; and also show that applying data programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points over a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the competition).

2016,Generalization of ERM in Stochastic Convex Optimization: The Dimension Strikes Back,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6467-generalization-of-erm-in-stochastic-convex-optimization-the-dimension-strikes-back.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6467-generalization-of-erm-in-stochastic-convex-optimization-the-dimension-strikes-back,In stochastic convex optimization the goal is to minimize a convex function $F(x) \doteq \E_{f\sim D}[f(x)]$ over a convex set $\K \subset \R^d$ where $D$ is some unknown distribution and each $f(\cdot)$ in the support of $D$ is convex over $\K$. The optimization is based on i.i.d.~samples $f^1;f^2;\ldots;f^n$ from $D$. A common approach to such problems is empirical risk minimization (ERM) that optimizes $F_S(x) \doteq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\leq n} f^i(x)$. Here we consider the question of how many samples are necessary for ERM to succeed and the closely related question of uniform convergence of $F_S$ to $F$ over $\K$. We demonstrate that in the standard $\ell_p/\ell_q$ setting of Lipschitz-bounded functions over a $\K$ of bounded radius; ERM requires sample size that scales linearly with the dimension $d$. This nearly matches standard upper bounds and improves on $\Omega(\log d)$ dependence proved for $\ell_2/\ell_2$ setting in (Shalev-Shwartz et al.  2009). In stark contrast; these problems can be solved using dimension-independent number of samples for $\ell_2/\ell_2$ setting and $\log d$ dependence for $\ell_1/\ell_\infty$ setting using other approaches. We also demonstrate that for a more general class of range-bounded (but not Lipschitz-bounded) stochastic convex programs an even stronger gap appears already in dimension 2.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6467-generalization-of-erm-in-stochastic-convex-optimization-the-dimension-strikes-back/bibtex,Vitaly Feldman
2016,Fast Distributed Submodular Cover: Public-Private Data Summarization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6540-fast-distributed-submodular-cover-public-private-data-summarization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6540-fast-distributed-submodular-cover-public-private-data-summarization,In this paper; we introduce the public-private framework of data summarization motivated by privacy concerns in personalized recommender systems and online social services. Such systems have usually access to massive data generated by a large pool of users. A major fraction of the data is public and is visible to (and can be used for) all users. However; each user can also contribute some private data that should not be shared with other users to ensure her privacy. The goal is to provide a succinct summary of massive dataset; ideally as small as possible; from which customized summaries can be built for each user; i.e. it can contain elements from the public data (for diversity) and users' private data (for personalization). To formalize the above challenge; we assume that the scoring function according to which a user evaluates the utility of her summary satisfies submodularity; a widely used notion in data summarization applications. Thus; we model the data summarization targeted to each user as an instance of a submodular cover problem. However; when the data is massive it is infeasible to use the centralized greedy algorithm to find a customized summary even for a single user. Moreover; for a large pool of users; it is too time consuming to find such summaries separately. Instead; we develop a fast distributed algorithm for submodular cover; FASTCOVER; that provides a succinct summary in one shot and for all users. We show that the solution provided by FASTCOVER is competitive with that of the centralized algorithm with the number of rounds that is exponentially smaller than state of the art results. Moreover; we have implemented FASTCOVER with Spark to demonstrate its practical performance on a number of concrete applications; including personalized location recommendation; personalized movie recommendation; and dominating set on tens of millions of data points and varying number of users.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6540-fast-distributed-submodular-cover-public-private-data-summarization/bibtex,Baharan Mirzasoleiman; Morteza Zadimoghaddam; Amin Karbasi

In this paper; we resolve many of the key algorithmic questions regarding robustness; memory efficiency; and differential privacy of tensor decomposition. We propose simple variants of the tensor power method which enjoy these strong properties. We propose the first streaming method with a linear memory requirement. Moreover; we present a noise calibrated tensor power method with efficient privacy guarantees. At the heart of all these guarantees lies a careful perturbation analysis derived in this paper which improves up on the existing results significantly.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6498-online-and-differentially-private-tensor-decomposition/bibtex,Yining Wang; Anima Anandkumar
2016,Towards Conceptual Compression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6542-towards-conceptual-compression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6542-towards-conceptual-compression,We introduce convolutional DRAW; a homogeneous deep generative model achieving state-of-the-art performance in latent variable image modeling. The algorithm naturally stratifies information into higher and lower level details; creating abstract features and as such addressing one of the fundamentally desired properties of representation learning. Furthermore; the hierarchical ordering of its latents creates the opportunity to selectively store global information about an image; yielding a high quality 'conceptual compression' framework.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6542-towards-conceptual-compression/bibtex,Karol Gregor; Frederic Besse; Danilo Jimenez Rezende; Ivo Danihelka; Daan Wierstra
2016,Community Detection on Evolving Graphs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6173-community-detection-on-evolving-graphs.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6173-community-detection-on-evolving-graphs,Clustering is a fundamental step in many information-retrieval and data-mining applications. Detecting clusters in graphs is also a key tool for finding the community structure in social and behavioral networks. In many of these applications; the input graph evolves over time in a continual and decentralized manner; and; to maintain a good clustering; the clustering algorithm needs to repeatedly probe the graph. Furthermore; there are often limitations on the frequency of such probes; either imposed explicitly by the online platform (e.g.; in the case of crawling proprietary social networks like twitter) or implicitly because of resource limitations (e.g.; in the case of crawling the web).  In this paper; we study a model of clustering on evolving graphs that captures this aspect of the problem. Our model is based on the classical stochastic block model; which has been used to assess rigorously the quality of various static clustering methods. In our model; the algorithm is supposed to reconstruct the planted clustering; given the ability to query for small pieces of local information about the graph; at a limited rate. We design and analyze clustering algorithms that work in this model; and show asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on their accuracy. Finally; we perform simulations; which demonstrate that our main asymptotic results hold true also in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6173-community-detection-on-evolving-graphs/bibtex,Aris Anagnostopoulos; Jakub ??cki; Silvio Lattanzi; Stefano Leonardi; Mohammad Mahdian
2016,Dimension-Free Iteration Complexity of Finite Sum Optimization Problems,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6087-dimension-free-iteration-complexity-of-finite-sum-optimization-problems.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6087-dimension-free-iteration-complexity-of-finite-sum-optimization-problems,Many canonical machine learning problems boil down to a convex optimization problem with a finite sum structure. However; whereas much progress has been made in developing faster algorithms for this setting; the inherent limitations of these problems are not satisfactorily addressed by existing lower bounds. Indeed; current bounds focus on first-order optimization algorithms; and only apply in the often unrealistic regime where the number of iterations is less than $\cO(d/n)$ (where $d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the number of samples). In this work; we extend the framework of Arjevani et al. \cite{arjevani2015lower;arjevani2016iteration} to provide new lower bounds; which are dimension-free; and go beyond the assumptions of current bounds; thereby covering standard finite sum optimization methods; e.g.; SAG; SAGA; SVRG; SDCA without duality; as well as stochastic coordinate-descent methods; such as SDCA and accelerated proximal SDCA.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6087-dimension-free-iteration-complexity-of-finite-sum-optimization-problems/bibtex,Yossi Arjevani; Ohad Shamir
2016,Total Variation Classes Beyond 1d: Minimax Rates; and the Limitations of Linear Smoothers,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6570-total-variation-classes-beyond-1d-minimax-rates-and-the-limitations-of-linear-smoothers.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6570-total-variation-classes-beyond-1d-minimax-rates-and-the-limitations-of-linear-smoothers,We consider the problem of estimating a function defined over $n$ locations on a $d$-dimensional grid (having all side lengths equal to $n^{1/d}$).  When the function is constrained to have discrete total variation bounded by $C_n$; we derive the minimax optimal (squared) $\ell_2$ estimation error rate; parametrized by $n; C_n$. Total variation denoising; also known as the fused lasso; is seen to be rate optimal.  Several simpler estimators exist; such as Laplacian smoothing and Laplacian eigenmaps.  A natural question is: can these simpler estimators perform just as well?  We prove that these estimators; and more broadly all estimators given by linear transformations of the input data; are suboptimal over the class of functions with bounded variation. This extends fundamental findings of Donoho and Johnstone (1998) on 1-dimensional total variation spaces to higher dimensions.  The implication is that the computationally simpler methods cannot be used for such sophisticated denoising tasks; without sacrificing statistical accuracy. We also derive minimax rates for discrete Sobolev spaces over $d$-dimensional grids; which are; in some sense; smaller than the total variation function spaces.  Indeed; these are small enough spaces that linear estimators can be optimal---and a few well-known ones are; such as Laplacian smoothing and Laplacian eigenmaps; as we show.  Lastly; we investigate the adaptivity of the total variation denoiser to these smaller Sobolev function spaces.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6570-total-variation-classes-beyond-1d-minimax-rates-and-the-limitations-of-linear-smoothers/bibtex,Veeranjaneyulu Sadhanala; Yu-Xiang Wang; Ryan J.

2016,RETAIN: An Interpretable Predictive Model for Healthcare using Reverse Time Attention Mechanism,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6321-retain-an-interpretable-predictive-model-for-healthcare-using-reverse-time-attention-mechanism.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6321-retain-an-interpretable-predictive-model-for-healthcare-using-reverse-time-attention-mechanism,Accuracy and interpretability are two dominant features of successful predictive models. Typically; a choice must be made in favor of complex black box models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) for accuracy versus less accurate but more interpretable traditional models such as logistic regression. This tradeoff poses challenges in medicine where both accuracy and interpretability are important. We addressed this challenge by developing the REverse Time AttentIoN model (RETAIN) for application to Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. RETAIN achieves high accuracy while remaining clinically interpretable and is based on a two-level neural attention model that detects influential past visits and significant clinical variables within those visits (e.g. key diagnoses). RETAIN mimics physician practice by attending the EHR data in a reverse time order so that recent clinical visits are likely to receive higher attention. RETAIN was tested on a large health system EHR dataset with 14 million visits completed by 263K patients over an 8 year period and demonstrated predictive accuracy and computational scalability comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as RNN; and ease of interpretability comparable to traditional models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6321-retain-an-interpretable-predictive-model-for-healthcare-using-reverse-time-attention-mechanism/bibtex,Edward Choi; Mohammad Taha Bahadori; Jimeng Sun; Joshua Kulas; Andy Schuetz; Walter Stewart
2016,Strategic Attentive Writer for Learning Macro-Actions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6414-strategic-attentive-writer-for-learning-macro-actions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6414-strategic-attentive-writer-for-learning-macro-actions,We present a novel deep recurrent neural network architecture that learns to build implicit plans in an end-to-end manner purely by interacting with an environment in reinforcement learning setting. The network builds an internal plan; which is continuously updated upon observation of the next input from the environment. It can also partition this internal representation into contiguous sub-sequences by learning for how long the plan can be committed to -- i.e. followed without replaning. Combining these properties; the proposed model; dubbed STRategic Attentive Writer (STRAW) can learn high-level; temporally abstracted macro-actions of varying lengths that are solely learnt from data without any prior information.  These macro-actions enable both structured exploration and economic computation. We experimentally demonstrate that STRAW delivers strong improvements on  several ATARI games by employing temporally extended planning strategies (e.g. Ms. Pacman and Frostbite). It is at the same time a general algorithm that can be applied on any sequence data. To that end; we also show that when trained on text prediction task; STRAW naturally predicts frequent n-grams (instead of macro-actions); demonstrating the generality of the approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6414-strategic-attentive-writer-for-learning-macro-actions/bibtex,Alexander Vezhnevets; Volodymyr Mnih; Simon Osindero; Alex Graves; Oriol Vinyals; John Agapiou; koray kavukcuoglu

In this well-studied model; we provide the first lower bounds giving a limit on the precision attainable by any algorithm for several variants of regression; notably linear regression with the absolute loss and the squared loss; as well as for classification with the hinge loss. We complement these lower bounds with a general purpose algorithm that gives an upper bound on the achievable precision limit in the setting of learning with missing data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6171-the-limits-of-learning-with-missing-data/bibtex,Brian Bullins; Elad Hazan; Tomer Koren
2016,Reconstructing Parameters of Spreading Models from Partial Observations,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6129-reconstructing-parameters-of-spreading-models-from-partial-observations.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6129-reconstructing-parameters-of-spreading-models-from-partial-observations,Spreading processes are often modelled as a stochastic dynamics occurring on top of a given network with edge weights corresponding to the transmission probabilities. Knowledge of veracious transmission probabilities is essential for prediction; optimization; and control of diffusion dynamics. Unfortunately; in most cases the transmission rates are unknown and need to be reconstructed from the spreading data. Moreover; in realistic settings it is impossible to monitor the state of each node at every time; and thus the data is highly incomplete. We introduce an efficient dynamic message-passing algorithm; which is able to reconstruct parameters of the spreading model given only partial information on the activation times of nodes in the network. The method is generalizable to a large class of dynamic models; as well to the case of temporal graphs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6129-reconstructing-parameters-of-spreading-models-from-partial-observations/bibtex,Andrey Lokhov

2016,Spatiotemporal Residual Networks for Video Action Recognition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6433-spatiotemporal-residual-networks-for-video-action-recognition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6433-spatiotemporal-residual-networks-for-video-action-recognition,Two-stream Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) have shown strong performance for human action recognition in videos. Recently; Residual Networks (ResNets) have arisen as a new technique to train extremely deep architectures. In this paper; we introduce spatiotemporal ResNets as a combination of these two approaches. Our novel architecture generalizes ResNets for the spatiotemporal domain by introducing residual connections in two ways. First; we inject residual connections between the appearance and motion pathways of a two-stream architecture to allow spatiotemporal interaction between the two streams. Second; we transform pretrained image ConvNets into spatiotemporal networks by equipping these with learnable convolutional filters that are initialized as temporal residual connections and operate on adjacent feature maps in time.  This approach slowly increases the spatiotemporal receptive field as the depth of the model increases and naturally integrates image ConvNet design principles. The whole model is trained end-to-end to allow hierarchical learning of complex spatiotemporal features. We evaluate our novel spatiotemporal ResNet using two widely used action recognition benchmarks where it exceeds the previous state-of-the-art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6433-spatiotemporal-residual-networks-for-video-action-recognition/bibtex,Christoph Feichtenhofer; Axel Pinz; Richard Wildes
2016,Linear Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6292-linear-contextual-bandits-with-knapsacks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6292-linear-contextual-bandits-with-knapsacks,We consider the linear contextual bandit problem with resource consumption; in addition to reward generation. In each round; the outcome of pulling an arm is a reward as well as a vector of resource consumptions. The expected values of these outcomes depend linearly on the context of that arm. The budget/capacity constraints require that the sum of these vectors doesn't exceed the budget in each dimension. The objective is once again to maximize the total reward. This problem turns out to be a common generalization of classic linear contextual bandits  (linContextual);  bandits with knapsacks (BwK); and the online stochastic packing problem (OSPP). We present algorithms with near-optimal regret bounds for this problem. Our bounds compare favorably to results on the unstructured version of the problem; where the relation between the contexts and the outcomes could be arbitrary; but the algorithm only competes against a fixed set of policies accessible through  an optimization oracle. We combine techniques from the work on linContextual; BwK and OSPP in a nontrivial manner while also tackling new difficulties that are not present in any of these special cases.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6292-linear-contextual-bandits-with-knapsacks/bibtex,Shipra Agrawal; Nikhil Devanur

Our main result gives function-specific lower and upper bounds on the number of stochastic subgradient evaluations needed to optimize either the function or its ``hardest local alternative'' to a given numerical precision.  The bounds are expressed in terms of a localized and computational analogue of the modulus of continuity that is central to statistical minimax analysis. We show how the computational modulus of continuity can be explicitly calculated in concrete cases; and relates to the curvature of the function at the optimum.  We also prove a superefficiency result that demonstrates it is a meaningful benchmark; acting as a computational analogue of the Fisher information in statistical estimation. The nature and practical implications of the results are demonstrated in simulations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6601-local-minimax-complexity-of-stochastic-convex-optimization/bibtex,sabyasachi chatterjee; John C.

One difficulty of this problem is that submodular optimization algorithms require the calculation of pairwise benefits for all items in the dataset. This is infeasible for large problems; so recent work proposed to only calculate nearest neighbor benefits. One limitation is that several strong assumptions were invoked to obtain provable approximation guarantees. In this paper we establish that these extra assumptions are not necessary?solving the sparsified problem will be almost optimal under the standard assumptions of the problem. We then analyze a different method of sparsification that is a better model for methods such as Locality Sensitive Hashing to accelerate the nearest neighbor computations and extend the use of the problem to a broader family of similarities. We validate our approach by demonstrating that it rapidly generates interpretable summaries.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6382-leveraging-sparsity-for-efficient-submodular-data-summarization/bibtex,Erik Lindgren; Shanshan Wu; Alexandros G.

2016,Stochastic Optimization for Large-scale Optimal Transport,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6566-stochastic-optimization-for-large-scale-optimal-transport.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6566-stochastic-optimization-for-large-scale-optimal-transport,Optimal transport (OT) defines a powerful framework to compare probability distributions in a geometrically faithful way. However; the practical impact of OT is still limited because of its computational burden. We propose a new class of stochastic optimization algorithms to cope with large-scale problems routinely encountered in machine learning applications. These methods are able to manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simply requiring to be able to draw samples from them; which is the typical setup in high-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretize these densities; while giving access to provably convergent methods that output the correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on two main ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of an expectation; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in a smooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithms that have a provably faster convergence. We instantiate these ideas in three different computational setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another; we show that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat the current state of the art finite dimensional OT solver (Sinkhorn's algorithm) ; (ii) when comparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density; a re-formulation (semi-discrete) of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradient descent; leading to better performance than approximately solving the problem by discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities; we propose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This is currently the only known method to solve this problem; and is more efficient than discretizing beforehand the two densities. We backup these claims on a set of discrete; semi-discrete and continuous benchmark problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6566-stochastic-optimization-for-large-scale-optimal-transport/bibtex,Aude Genevay; Marco Cuturi; Gabriel Peyr?; Francis Bach

Gaifman models learn feature representations bottom up from representations of locally connected and bounded-size regions of knowledge bases (KBs).  Considering local and bounded-size neighborhoods of knowledge bases renders logical inference and learning tractable; mitigates the problem of overfitting; and facilitates weight sharing. Gaifman models sample neighborhoods of knowledge bases so as to make the learned relational models more robust to missing objects and relations which is a common situation in open-world KBs. We present the core ideas of Gaifman models and apply them to large-scale relational learning problems. We also discuss the ways in which Gaifman models relate to some existing relational machine learning approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6098-discriminative-gaifman-models/bibtex,Mathias Niepert

We define DSFs and situate them within the broader context of classes of submodular functions in relationship both to various matroid ranks and sums of concave composed with modular functions (SCMs). Notably; we find that DSFs constitute a strictly broader class than SCMs; thus motivating their use; but that they do not comprise all submodular functions.  Interestingly; some DSFs can be seen as special cases of certain deep neural networks (DNNs); hence the name.  Finally; we provide a method to learn DSFs in a max-margin framework; and offer preliminary results applying this both to synthetic and real-world data instances.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6361-deep-submodular-functions-definitions-and-learning/bibtex,Brian W.

Understanding the inner workings of such computational brains is both fascinating basic science that is interesting in its own right---similar to why we study the human brain---and will enable researchers to further improve DNNs. One path to understanding how a neural network functions internally is to study what each of its neurons has learned to detect. One such method is called activation maximization; which synthesizes an input (e.g. an image) that highly activates a neuron. Here we dramatically improve the qualitative state of the art of activation maximization by harnessing a powerful; learned prior: a deep generator network. The algorithm (1) generates qualitatively state-of-the-art synthetic images that look almost real; (2) reveals the features learned by each neuron in an interpretable way; (3) generalizes well to new datasets and somewhat well to different network architectures without requiring the prior to be relearned; and (4) can be considered as a high-quality generative method (in this case; by generating novel; creative; interesting; recognizable images).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6519-synthesizing-the-preferred-inputs-for-neurons-in-neural-networks-via-deep-generator-networks/bibtex,Anh Nguyen; Alexey Dosovitskiy; Jason Yosinski; Thomas Brox; Jeff Clune

Despite its simplicity; Split LBI outperforms the popular generalized Lasso in both theory and experiments. A theory of path consistency is presented that equipped with a proper early stopping; Split LBI may achieve model selection consistency under a family of Irrepresentable Conditions which can be weaker than the necessary and sufficient condition for generalized Lasso. Furthermore; some $\ell_2$ error bounds are also given at the minimax optimal rates. The utility and benefit of the algorithm are illustrated by applications on both traditional image denoising and a novel example on partial order ranking.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6288-split-lbi-an-iterative-regularization-path-with-structural-sparsity/bibtex,Chendi Huang; Xinwei Sun; Jiechao Xiong; Yuan Yao
2016,An equivalence between high dimensional Bayes optimal inference and M-estimation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6599-an-equivalence-between-high-dimensional-bayes-optimal-inference-and-m-estimation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6599-an-equivalence-between-high-dimensional-bayes-optimal-inference-and-m-estimation,Due to the computational difficulty of performing MMSE (minimum mean squared error) inference; maximum a posteriori (MAP) is often used as a surrogate. However; the accuracy of MAP is suboptimal for high dimensional inference; where the number of model parameters is of the same order as the number of samples. In this work we demonstrate how MMSE performance is asymptotically achievable via optimization with an appropriately selected convex penalty and regularization function which are a smoothed version of the widely applied MAP algorithm. Our findings provide a new derivation and interpretation for recent optimal M-estimators discovered by El Karoui; et. al. PNAS 2013 as well as extending to non-additive noise models. We demonstrate the performance of these optimal M-estimators with numerical simulations.  Overall; at the heart of our work is the revelation of a remarkable equivalence between two seemingly very different computational problems: namely that of high dimensional Bayesian integration; and high dimensional convex optimization.  In essence we show that the former computationally difficult integral may be computed by solving the latter; simpler optimization problem.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6599-an-equivalence-between-high-dimensional-bayes-optimal-inference-and-m-estimation/bibtex,Madhu Advani; Surya Ganguli

Our results reveal a phase transition in the expressivity of random deep networks; with networks in the chaotic phase computing nonlinear functions whose global curvature grows exponentially with depth; but not with width. We prove that this generic class of random functions cannot be efficiently computed by any shallow network; going beyond prior work that restricts their analysis to single functions. Moreover; we formally quantify and demonstrate the long conjectured idea that deep networks can disentangle exponentially curved manifolds in input space into flat manifolds in hidden space.  Our theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of deep networks is broadly applicable and provides a basis for quantifying previously abstract notions about the geometry of deep functions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6322-exponential-expressivity-in-deep-neural-networks-through-transient-chaos/bibtex,Ben Poole; Subhaneil Lahiri; Maithra Raghu; Jascha Sohl-Dickstein; Surya Ganguli

The SEARCH oracle models the situation where a human searches a database to seed or counterexample an existing solution. SEARCH is stronger than LABEL while being natural to implement in many situations. We show that an algorithm using both oracles can provide exponentially large problem-dependent improvements over LABEL alone.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6183-search-improves-label-for-active-learning/bibtex,Alina Beygelzimer; Daniel J.

We propose a nonlinear time series model aimed at characterizing interpretable dynamics from neural trajectories. Our model assumes low-dimensional continuous dynamics in a finite volume. It incorporates a prior assumption about globally contractional dynamics to avoid overly enthusiastic extrapolation outside of the support of observed trajectories. We show that our model can recover qualitative features of the phase portrait such as attractors; slow points; and bifurcations; while also producing reliable long-term future predictions in a variety of dynamical models and in real neural data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6543-interpretable-nonlinear-dynamic-modeling-of-neural-trajectories/bibtex,Yuan Zhao; Il Memming Park

First; it does not assume any generative model and based on a worst-case performance metric. Second; it is comparative; namely performance is measured with respect to a given hypothesis class. This allows to avoid known computational hardness results and improper algorithms based on convex relaxations.  We show how several families of unsupervised learning models; which were previously only analyzed under probabilistic assumptions and are otherwise provably intractable; can be efficiently learned in our framework by convex optimization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6533-a-non-generative-framework-and-convex-relaxations-for-unsupervised-learning/bibtex,Elad Hazan; Tengyu Ma

Unfortunately; despite increasing interest in FMs; there exists to date no efficient training algorithm for higher-order FMs (HOFMs). In this paper; we present the first generic yet efficient algorithms for training arbitrary-order HOFMs. We also present new variants of HOFMs with shared parameters; which greatly reduce model size and prediction times while maintaining similar accuracy.  We demonstrate the proposed approaches on four different link prediction tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6144-higher-order-factorization-machines/bibtex,Mathieu Blondel; Akinori Fujino; Naonori Ueda; Masakazu Ishihata
2016,Convergence guarantees for kernel-based quadrature rules in misspecified settings,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6174-convergence-guarantees-for-kernel-based-quadrature-rules-in-misspecified-settings.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6174-convergence-guarantees-for-kernel-based-quadrature-rules-in-misspecified-settings,Kernel-based quadrature rules are becoming important in machine learning and statistics; as they achieve super-$?sqrt{n}$ convergence rates in numerical integration; and thus provide alternatives to Monte Carlo integration in challenging settings where integrands are expensive to evaluate or where integrands are high dimensional. These rules are based on the assumption that the integrand has a certain degree of smoothness; which is expressed as that the integrand belongs to a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However; this assumption can be violated in practice (e.g.; when the integrand is a black box function); and no general theory has been established for the convergence of kernel quadratures in such misspecified settings. Our contribution is in proving that kernel quadratures can be consistent even when the integrand does not belong to the assumed RKHS; i.e.;  when the integrand is less smooth than assumed. Specifically; we derive convergence rates that depend on the (unknown) lesser smoothness of the integrand; where the degree of smoothness is expressed via powers of RKHSs or via Sobolev spaces.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6174-convergence-guarantees-for-kernel-based-quadrature-rules-in-misspecified-settings/bibtex,Motonobu Kanagawa; Bharath K.

We show that in GLMs with random (not necessarily Gaussian) design; the GLM coefficients are approximately proportional to the corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficients. Using this relation; we design an algorithm that achieves the same accuracy as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)  through iterations that  attain up to a cubic convergence rate; and that are cheaper than  any batch optimization algorithm by at least a factor of $\mathcal{O}(p)$. We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithm; and analyze the convergence behavior in terms of data dimensions. % Finally; we demonstrate the performance of  our algorithm through extensive numerical studies  on large-scale real and synthetic datasets; and show that it achieves the highest performance compared to several other widely used optimization algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6522-scaled-least-squares-estimator-for-glms-in-large-scale-problems/bibtex,Murat A.

We analyze the worst case competitive ratio of two primal-dual algorithms for a class of online convex (conic) optimization problems that contains the previous examples as special cases defined on the positive orthant.  We derive a sufficient condition on the objective function that guarantees a constant worst case competitive ratio (greater than or equal to $\frac{1}{2}$) for monotone objective functions.  We provide new examples of online problems on the positive orthant % and the positive semidefinite cone  that satisfy the sufficient condition.  We show how smoothing can improve the competitive ratio of these algorithms; and in particular for separable functions; we show that the optimal smoothing can be derived by solving a convex optimization problem. This result allows us to directly optimize the competitive ratio bound over a class of smoothing functions; and hence  design effective smoothing customized for a given cost function.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6073-designing-smoothing-functions-for-improved-worst-case-competitive-ratio-in-online-optimization/bibtex,Reza Eghbali; Maryam Fazel

Assuming data about the predictor; target; and membership in the protected group are available; we show how to optimally adjust any learned predictor so as to remove discrimination according to our definition.

2016,Unsupervised Learning from Noisy Networks with Applications to Hi-C Data,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6291-unsupervised-learning-from-noisy-networks-with-applications-to-hi-c-data.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6291-unsupervised-learning-from-noisy-networks-with-applications-to-hi-c-data,Complex networks play an important role in a plethora of disciplines in natural sciences. Cleaning up noisy observed networks; poses an important challenge in network analysis Existing methods utilize labeled data to alleviate the noise effect in the network.  However; labeled data is usually expensive to collect while unlabeled data can be gathered cheaply. In this paper; we propose an optimization framework to mine useful structures from noisy networks in an unsupervised manner. The key feature of our optimization framework is its ability to utilize local structures as well as global patterns in the network. We extend our method to incorporate multi-resolution networks in order to add further resistance to high-levels of noise. We also generalize our framework to utilize partial labels to enhance the performance. We specifically focus our method on multi-resolution Hi-C data by recovering clusters of genomic regions that co-localize in 3D space. Additionally; we use Capture-C-generated partial labels to further denoise the Hi-C network. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in denoising the network and improving community detection results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6291-unsupervised-learning-from-noisy-networks-with-applications-to-hi-c-data/bibtex,Bo Wang; Junjie Zhu; Armin Pourshafeie; Oana Ursu; Serafim Batzoglou; Anshul Kundaje

The CoT not only models the confusions or error properties of individual decision makers and their evolution over time; but also allows us to obtain diagnostic insights into the collective decision making process in an interpretable manner. To this end; the CoT models the confusions of the decision makers and their evolution over time via time-dependent confusion matrices. Interpretable insights are obtained by grouping similar decision makers (and items being judged) into clusters and representing each such cluster with an appropriate prototype and identifying the most important features characterizing the cluster via a subspace feature indicator vector. Experimentation with real world data on bail decisions; asthma treatments; and insurance policy approval decisions demonstrates that CoT can accurately model and explain the confusions of decision makers and their evolution over time.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6234-confusions-over-time-an-interpretable-bayesian-model-to-characterize-trends-in-decision-making/bibtex,Himabindu Lakkaraju; Jure Leskovec
2016,Deconvolving Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6283-deconvolving-feedback-loops-in-recommender-systems.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6283-deconvolving-feedback-loops-in-recommender-systems,Collaborative filtering is a popular technique to infer users' preferences on new content based on the collective information of all users preferences. Recommender systems then use this information to make personalized suggestions to users. When users accept these recommendations it creates a feedback loop in the recommender system; and these loops iteratively influence the collaborative filtering algorithm's predictions over time. We investigate whether it is possible to identify items affected by these feedback loops. We state sufficient assumptions to deconvolve the feedback loops while keeping the inverse solution tractable. We furthermore develop a metric to unravel the recommender system's influence on the entire user-item rating matrix. We use this metric on synthetic and real-world datasets to (1) identify the extent to which the recommender system affects the final rating matrix; (2) rank frequently recommended items; and (3) distinguish whether a user's rated item was recommended or an intrinsic preference. Our results indicate that it is possible to recover the ratings matrix of intrinsic user preferences using a single snapshot of the ratings matrix without any temporal information.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6283-deconvolving-feedback-loops-in-recommender-systems/bibtex,Ayan Sinha; David F.

We achieve this by performing probabilistic inference using a recurrent neural network that attends to scene elements and processes them one at a time. Crucially; the model itself learns to choose the appropriate number of inference steps. We use this scheme to learn to perform inference in partially specified 2D models (variable-sized variational auto-encoders) and fully specified 3D models (probabilistic renderers). We show that such models learn to identify multiple objects - counting; locating and classifying the elements of a scene - without any supervision; e.g.; decomposing 3D images with various numbers of objects in a single forward pass of a neural network at unprecedented speed. We further show that the networks produce accurate inferences when compared to supervised counterparts; and that their structure leads to improved generalization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6230-attend-infer-repeat-fast-scene-understanding-with-generative-models/bibtex,S.

Much of the existing work has focused on matrices with low-rank structure; and limited progress has been made on matrices with other types of structure. In this paper we present non-asymptotic analysis for estimation of generally structured matrices via the generalized Dantzig selector based on sub-Gaussian measurements. We show that the estimation error can always be succinctly expressed in terms of a few geometric measures such as Gaussian widths of suitable sets associated with the structure of the underlying true matrix. Further; we derive general bounds on these geometric measures for structures characterized by unitarily invariant norms; a large family covering most matrix norms of practical interest. Examples are provided to illustrate the utility of our theoretical development.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6394-structured-matrix-recovery-via-the-generalized-dantzig-selector/bibtex,Sheng Chen; Arindam Banerjee

The proposed NonconvEx primal-dual SpliTTing (NESTT) algorithm splits the problem into $N$ subproblems; and utilizes an augmented Lagrangian based primal-dual scheme to solve it in a distributed and stochastic manner. With a special non-uniform sampling; a version of NESTT achieves $\epsilon$-stationary solution  using $\mathcal{O}((\sum_{i=1}^N\sqrt{L_i/N})^2/\epsilon)$ gradient evaluations; which can be up to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ times better than the (proximal) gradient descent methods. It also achieves Q-linear convergence rate for nonconvex $\ell_1$ penalized quadratic problems with polyhedral constraints. Further; we reveal  a fundamental connection between {\it primal-dual} based methods and a few {\it primal only} methods such as IAG/SAG/SAGA.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6506-nestt-a-nonconvex-primal-dual-splitting-method-for-distributed-and-stochastic-optimization/bibtex,Davood Hajinezhad; Mingyi Hong; Tuo Zhao; Zhaoran Wang

These models provide probabilistic interpretations of common combinatorial optimization tasks such as image segmentation. In this paper; we focus primarily on parameter estimation in the models from  known upper-bounds on the intractable  log-partition function. We show that the bound based on separable optimization on the base polytope of the submodular function is always inferior to a bound based on ``perturb-and-MAP'' ideas. Then; to learn parameters; given that our approximation of the log-partition function is an expectation (over our own randomization); we use a stochastic subgradient technique to maximize a lower-bound on the log-likelihood. This can also be extended to conditional maximum likelihood. We illustrate our new results in a set of experiments in binary image denoising; where we highlight the flexibility of a probabilistic model to learn with missing data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6402-parameter-learning-for-log-supermodular-distributions/bibtex,Tatiana Shpakova; Francis Bach

In this work we introduce the Pairwise Choice Markov Chain (PCMC) model of discrete choice; an inferentially tractable model that does not assume these traditional axioms while still satisfying the foundational axiom of uniform expansion; which can be viewed as a weaker version of Luce's axiom. We show that the PCMC model significantly outperforms the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model in prediction tasks on two empirical data sets known to exhibit violations of Luce's axiom. Our analysis also synthesizes several recent observations connecting the Multinomial Logit model and Markov chains; the PCMC model retains the Multinomial Logit model as a special case.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6287-pairwise-choice-markov-chains/bibtex,Stephen Ragain; Johan Ugander

We study the query and computational complexity of clustering in this framework. We consider a setting where the expert conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion of margin.  We show that there is a trade off between computational complexity and query complexity; We prove that for the case of $k$-means clustering (i.e.; when the expert conforms to a solution of $k$-means); having access to relatively few such queries allows efficient solutions to otherwise NP hard problems.  In particular; we provide a probabilistic polynomial-time (BPP) algorithm  for clustering in this setting that asks $O\big(k^2\log k + k\log n)$ same-cluster queries and runs with time complexity $O\big(kn\log n)$ (where $k$ is the number of clusters and $n$ is the number of instances). The success of the algorithm is guaranteed for data satisfying the margin condition under which; without queries; we show that the problem is NP hard. We also prove a lower bound on the number of queries needed to have a computationally efficient clustering algorithm in this setting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6449-clustering-with-same-cluster-queries/bibtex,Hassan Ashtiani; Shrinu Kushagra; Shai Ben-David

In this paper; we propose Anisotropic Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN); a generalization of classical CNNs to non-Euclidean domains; where classical convolutions are replaced by projections over a set of oriented anisotropic diffusion kernels. We use ACNNs to effectively learn intrinsic dense correspondences between deformable shapes; a fundamental problem in geometry processing; arising in a wide variety of applications. We tested ACNNs performance in very challenging settings; achieving state-of-the-art results on some of the most difficult recent correspondence benchmarks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6045-learning-shape-correspondence-with-anisotropic-convolutional-neural-networks/bibtex,Davide Boscaini; Jonathan Masci; Emanuele Rodol?; Michael Bronstein
2016,?Congruent? and ?Opposite? Neurons: Sisters for Multisensory Integration and Segregation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6317-congruent-and-opposite-neurons-sisters-for-multisensory-integration-and-segregation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6317-congruent-and-opposite-neurons-sisters-for-multisensory-integration-and-segregation,Experiments reveal that in the dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas; where visual and vestibular cues are integrated to infer heading direction; there are two types of neurons with roughly the same number. One is ?congruent? cells; whose preferred heading directions are similar in response to visual and vestibular cues; and the other is ?opposite? cells; whose preferred heading directions are nearly ?opposite? (with an offset of 180 degree) in response to visual vs. vestibular cues. Congruent neurons are known to be responsible for cue integration; but the computational role of opposite neurons remains largely unknown. Here; we propose that opposite neurons may serve to encode the disparity information between cues necessary for multisensory segregation. We build a computational model composed of two reciprocally coupled modules; MSTd and VIP; and each module consists of groups of congruent and opposite neurons. In the model; congruent neurons in two modules are reciprocally connected with each other in the congruent manner; whereas opposite neurons are reciprocally connected in the opposite manner. Mimicking the experimental protocol; our model reproduces the characteristics of congruent and opposite neurons; and demonstrates that in each module; the sisters of congruent and opposite neurons can jointly achieve optimal multisensory information integration and segregation. This study sheds light on our understanding of how the brain implements optimal multisensory integration and segregation concurrently in a distributed manner.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6317-congruent-and-opposite-neurons-sisters-for-multisensory-integration-and-segregation/bibtex,Wen-Hao Zhang; He Wang; K.

2016,Launch and Iterate: Reducing Prediction Churn,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6053-launch-and-iterate-reducing-prediction-churn.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6053-launch-and-iterate-reducing-prediction-churn,Practical applications of machine learning often involve successive training iterations with changes to features and training examples. Ideally; changes in the output of any new model should only be improvements (wins) over the previous iteration; but in practice the predictions may change neutrally for many examples; resulting in extra net-zero wins and losses; referred to as unnecessary churn. These changes in the predictions are problematic for usability for some applications; and make it harder and more expensive to measure if a change is statistically significant positive. In this paper; we formulate the problem and present a stabilization operator to regularize a classifier towards a previous classifier. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo stabilization operator to produce a model with more consistent predictions without adversely affecting accuracy. We investigate the properties of the proposal with theoretical analysis. Experiments on benchmark datasets for different classification algorithms demonstrate the method and the resulting reduction in churn.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6053-launch-and-iterate-reducing-prediction-churn/bibtex,Mahdi Milani Fard; Quentin Cormier; Kevin Canini; Maya Gupta
2016,Optimistic Gittins Indices,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6036-optimistic-gittins-indices.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6036-optimistic-gittins-indices,Starting with the Thomspon sampling algorithm; recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in Bayesian algorithms for the Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problem. These algorithms seek to exploit prior information on arm biases and while several have been shown to be regret optimal; their design has not emerged from a principled approach. In contrast; if one cared about Bayesian regret discounted over an infinite horizon at a fixed; pre-specified rate; the celebrated Gittins index theorem offers an optimal algorithm. Unfortunately; the Gittins analysis does not appear to carry over to minimizing Bayesian regret over all sufficiently large horizons and computing a Gittins index is onerous relative to essentially any incumbent index scheme for the Bayesian MAB problem.   The present paper proposes a sequence of 'optimistic' approximations to the Gittins index. We show that the use of these approximations in concert with the use of an increasing discount factor appears to offer a compelling alternative to a variety of index schemes proposed for the Bayesian MAB problem in recent years. In addition; we show that the simplest of these approximations yields regret that matches the Lai-Robbins lower bound; including achieving matching constants.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6036-optimistic-gittins-indices/bibtex,Eli Gutin; Vivek Farias

However; it is now recognized that such processes have their limitations in terms of the ability to capture power law behavior. As such there is now considerable interest in models based on the Stable Processs (SP); Generalized Gamma process (GGP) and Stable-beta process (SBP). These models present new challenges in terms of practical statistical implementation. In analogy to tractable processes such as the finite-dimensional Dirichlet process; we describe a class of random processes; we call iid finite-dimensional BFRY processes; that enables one to begin to develop efficient posterior inference algorithms such as variational Bayes that readily scale to massive datasets. For illustrative purposes; we describe a simple variational Bayes algorithm for normalized SP mixture models; and demonstrate its usefulness with experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6348-finite-dimensional-bfry-priors-and-variational-bayesian-inference-for-power-law-models/bibtex,Juho Lee; Lancelot F.

2016,Consistent Estimation of Functions of Data Missing Non-Monotonically and Not at Random,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6297-consistent-estimation-of-functions-of-data-missing-non-monotonically-and-not-at-random.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6297-consistent-estimation-of-functions-of-data-missing-non-monotonically-and-not-at-random,Missing records are a perennial problem in analysis of complex data of all types; when the target of inference is some function of the full data law.   In simple cases; where data is missing at random or completely at random (Rubin; 1976); well-known adjustments exist that result in consistent estimators of target quantities.  Assumptions underlying these estimators are generally not realistic in practical missing data problems.  Unfortunately; consistent estimators in more complex cases where data is missing not at random; and where no ordering on variables induces monotonicity of missingness status are not known in general; with some notable exceptions (Robins; 1997); (Tchetgen Tchetgen et al; 2016); (Sadinle and Reiter; 2016).  In this paper; we propose a general class of consistent estimators for cases where data is missing not at random; and missingness status is non-monotonic.  Our estimators; which are generalized inverse probability weighting estimators; make no assumptions on the underlying full data law; but instead place independence restrictions; and certain other fairly mild assumptions; on the distribution of missingness status conditional on the data.  The assumptions we place on the distribution of missingness status conditional on the data  can be viewed as a version of a conditional Markov random field (MRF) corresponding to a chain graph.  Assumptions embedded in our model permit identification from the observed data law; and admit a natural fitting procedure based on the pseudo likelihood approach of (Besag; 1975).  We illustrate our approach with a simple simulation study; and an analysis of risk of premature birth in women in Botswana exposed to highly active anti-retroviral therapy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6297-consistent-estimation-of-functions-of-data-missing-non-monotonically-and-not-at-random/bibtex,Ilya Shpitser
2016,The Parallel Knowledge Gradient Method for Batch Bayesian Optimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6307-the-parallel-knowledge-gradient-method-for-batch-bayesian-optimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6307-the-parallel-knowledge-gradient-method-for-batch-bayesian-optimization,In many applications of black-box optimization; one can evaluate multiple points simultaneously; e.g. when evaluating the performances of several different neural network architectures in a parallel computing environment.  In this paper; we develop a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm --- the parallel knowledge gradient method. By construction; this method provides the one-step Bayes optimal batch of points to sample. We provide an efficient strategy for computing this Bayes-optimal batch of points; and we demonstrate that the parallel knowledge gradient method finds global optima significantly faster than previous batch Bayesian optimization algorithms on both synthetic test functions and when tuning hyperparameters of practical machine learning algorithms; especially when function evaluations are noisy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6307-the-parallel-knowledge-gradient-method-for-batch-bayesian-optimization/bibtex,Jian Wu; Peter Frazier
2016,New Liftable Classes for First-Order Probabilistic Inference,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6603-new-liftable-classes-for-first-order-probabilistic-inference.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6603-new-liftable-classes-for-first-order-probabilistic-inference,Statistical relational models provide compact encodings of probabilistic dependencies in relational domains; but result in highly intractable graphical models. The goal of lifted inference is to carry out probabilistic inference without needing to reason about each individual separately; by instead treating exchangeable; undistinguished objects as a whole. In this paper; we study the domain recursion inference rule; which; despite its central role in early theoretical results on domain-lifted inference; has later been believed redundant. We show that this rule is more powerful than expected; and in fact significantly extends the range of models for which lifted inference runs in time polynomial in the number of individuals in the domain. This includes an open problem called S4; the symmetric transitivity model; and a first-order logic encoding of the birthday paradox. We further identify new classes S2FO2 and S2RU of domain-liftable theories; which respectively subsume FO2 and recursively unary theories; the largest classes of domain-liftable theories known so far; and show that using domain recursion can achieve exponential speedup even in theories that cannot fully be lifted with the existing set of inference rules.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6603-new-liftable-classes-for-first-order-probabilistic-inference/bibtex,Seyed Mehran Kazemi; Angelika Kimmig; Guy Van den Broeck; David Poole

Our algorithm is computationally efficient; assuming access to an offline optimization oracle; and enjoys a regret of order $O((KT)^{\frac{2}{3}}(\log N)^{\frac{1}{3}})$; where $K$ is the number of actions; $T$ is the number of iterations; and $N$ is the number of baseline policies. Our result is the first to break the $O(T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ barrier achieved by recent algorithms; which was left as a major open problem. Our analysis employs the recent relaxation framework of (Rakhlin and Sridharan; ICML'16).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6400-improved-regret-bounds-for-oracle-based-adversarial-contextual-bandits/bibtex,Vasilis Syrgkanis; Haipeng Luo; Akshay Krishnamurthy; Robert E.

2016,MoCap-guided Data Augmentation for 3D Pose Estimation in the Wild,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6563-mocap-guided-data-augmentation-for-3d-pose-estimation-in-the-wild.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6563-mocap-guided-data-augmentation-for-3d-pose-estimation-in-the-wild,This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose estimation in the wild. A significant challenge is the lack of training data; i.e.; 2D images of humans annotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN architectures. Here; we propose a solution to generate a large set of photorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations. We introduce an image-based synthesis engine that artificially augments a dataset of real images with 2D human pose annotations using 3D Motion Capture (MoCap) data. Given a candidate 3D pose our algorithm selects for each joint an image whose 2D pose locally matches the projected 3D pose. The selected images are then combined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image patches in a kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to train an end-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the training data into a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as a K-way classification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large training sets such as ours. Our method outperforms the state of the art in terms of 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows promising results for in-the-wild images (LSP). This demonstrates that CNNs trained on artificial images generalize well to real images.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6563-mocap-guided-data-augmentation-for-3d-pose-estimation-in-the-wild/bibtex,Gregory Rogez; Cordelia Schmid
2016,High resolution neural connectivity from incomplete tracing data using nonnegative spline regression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6244-high-resolution-neural-connectivity-from-incomplete-tracing-data-using-nonnegative-spline-regression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6244-high-resolution-neural-connectivity-from-incomplete-tracing-data-using-nonnegative-spline-regression,Whole-brain neural connectivity data are now available from viral tracing experiments; which reveal the connections between a source injection site and elsewhere in the brain. These hold the promise of revealing spatial patterns of connectivity throughout the mammalian brain. To achieve this goal; we seek to fit a weighted; nonnegative adjacency matrix among 100 ?m brain ?voxels? using viral tracer data. Despite a multi-year experimental effort; injections provide incomplete coverage; and the number of voxels in our data is orders of magnitude larger than the number of injections; making the problem severely underdetermined. Furthermore; projection data are missing within the injection site because local connections there are not separable from the injection signal.  We use a novel machine-learning algorithm to meet these challenges and develop a spatially explicit; voxel-scale connectivity map of the mouse visual system. Our method combines three features: a matrix completion loss for missing data; a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the problem; and (optionally) a low rank factorization. We demonstrate the consistency of our estimator using synthetic data and then apply it to newly available Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system. Our algorithm is significantly more predictive than current state of the art approaches which assume regions to be homogeneous. We demonstrate the efficacy of a low rank version on visual cortex data and discuss the possibility of extending this to a whole-brain connectivity matrix at the voxel scale.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6244-high-resolution-neural-connectivity-from-incomplete-tracing-data-using-nonnegative-spline-regression/bibtex,Kameron D.

2016,On Robustness of Kernel Clustering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6389-on-robustness-of-kernel-clustering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6389-on-robustness-of-kernel-clustering,Clustering is an important unsupervised learning problem in machine learning and statistics. Among many existing algorithms; kernel \km has drawn much research attention due to its ability to find non-linear cluster boundaries and its inherent simplicity. There are two main approaches for kernel k-means: SVD of the kernel matrix and convex relaxations. Despite the attention kernel clustering has received both from theoretical and applied quarters; not much is known about robustness of the methods. In this paper we first introduce a semidefinite programming relaxation for the kernel clustering problem; then prove that under a suitable model specification; both K-SVD and SDP approaches are consistent in the limit; albeit SDP is strongly consistent; i.e. achieves exact recovery; whereas K-SVD is weakly consistent; i.e. the fraction of misclassified nodes vanish. Also the error bounds suggest that SDP is more resilient towards outliers; which we also demonstrate with experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6389-on-robustness-of-kernel-clustering/bibtex,Bowei Yan; Purnamrita Sarkar
2016,Learning Sensor Multiplexing Design through Back-propagation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6251-learning-sensor-multiplexing-design-through-back-propagation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6251-learning-sensor-multiplexing-design-through-back-propagation,Recent progress on many imaging and vision tasks has been driven by the use of deep feed-forward neural networks; which are trained by propagating gradients of a loss defined on the final output; back through the network up to the first layer that operates directly on the image. We propose back-propagating one step further---to learn camera sensor designs jointly with networks that carry out inference on the images they capture. In this paper; we specifically consider the design and inference problems in a typical color camera---where the sensor is able to measure only one color channel at each pixel location; and computational inference is required to reconstruct a full color image. We learn the camera sensor's color multiplexing pattern by encoding it as layer whose learnable weights determine which color channel; from among a fixed set; will be measured at each location. These weights are jointly trained with those of a reconstruction network that operates on the corresponding sensor measurements to produce a full color image. Our network achieves significant improvements in accuracy over the traditional Bayer pattern used in most color cameras. It automatically learns to employ a sparse color measurement approach similar to that of a recent design; and moreover; improves upon that design by learning an optimal layout for these measurements.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6251-learning-sensor-multiplexing-design-through-back-propagation/bibtex,Ayan Chakrabarti

We consider the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve the program; which provides a sparse solution that can be interpreted as inserting a hidden unit at each iteration; so that the optimization process takes the form of a sequence of finite models of increasing complexity.  As a side benefit; this can be used to easily and efficiently identify an appropriate number of hidden units during the optimization. The resulting model can also be used as an initialization for typical state-of-the-art RBM training algorithms such as contrastive divergence; leading to models with consistently higher test likelihood than random initialization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6342-learning-infinite-rbms-with-frank-wolfe/bibtex,Wei Ping; Qiang Liu; Alexander T.

2016,Estimating the Size of a Large Network and its Communities from a Random Sample,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6229-estimating-the-size-of-a-large-network-and-its-communities-from-a-random-sample.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6229-estimating-the-size-of-a-large-network-and-its-communities-from-a-random-sample,Most real-world networks are too large to be measured or studied directly and there is substantial interest in estimating global network properties from smaller sub-samples. One of the most important global properties is the number of vertices/nodes in the network. Estimating the number of vertices in a large network is a major challenge in computer science; epidemiology; demography; and intelligence analysis. In this paper we consider a population random graph G = (V;E) from the stochastic block model (SBM) with K communities/blocks. A sample is obtained by randomly choosing a subset W and letting G(W) be the induced subgraph in G of the vertices in W. In addition to G(W); we observe the total degree of each sampled vertex and its block membership. Given this partial information; we propose an efficient PopULation Size Estimation algorithm; called PULSE; that accurately estimates the size of the whole population as well as the size of each community. To support our theoretical analysis; we perform an exhaustive set of experiments to study the effects of sample size; K; and SBM model parameters on the accuracy of the estimates. The experimental results also demonstrate that PULSE significantly outperforms a widely-used method called the network scale-up estimator in a wide variety of scenarios.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6229-estimating-the-size-of-a-large-network-and-its-communities-from-a-random-sample/bibtex,Lin Chen; Amin Karbasi; Forrest W.

2016,A Comprehensive Linear Speedup Analysis for Asynchronous Stochastic Parallel Optimization from Zeroth-Order to First-Order,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6551-a-comprehensive-linear-speedup-analysis-for-asynchronous-stochastic-parallel-optimization-from-zeroth-order-to-first-order.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6551-a-comprehensive-linear-speedup-analysis-for-asynchronous-stochastic-parallel-optimization-from-zeroth-order-to-first-order,Asynchronous parallel optimization received substantial successes and extensive attention recently. One of core theoretical questions is how much speedup (or benefit) the asynchronous parallelization can bring to us. This paper provides a comprehensive and generic analysis to study the speedup property for a broad range of asynchronous parallel stochastic algorithms from the zeroth order to the first order methods. Our result recovers or improves existing analysis on special cases; provides more insights for understanding the asynchronous parallel behaviors; and suggests a novel asynchronous parallel zeroth order method for the first time. Our experiments provide novel applications of the proposed asynchronous parallel zeroth order method on hyper parameter tuning and model blending problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6551-a-comprehensive-linear-speedup-analysis-for-asynchronous-stochastic-parallel-optimization-from-zeroth-order-to-first-order/bibtex,Xiangru Lian; Huan Zhang; Cho-Jui Hsieh; Yijun Huang; Ji Liu

Approximate submodularity implicitly appears in a wide range of applications as in many cases errors in evaluation of a submodular function break submodularity. Say that $F$ is $\eps$-approximately submodular if there exists a submodular function $f$ such that $(1-\eps)f(S) \leq F(S)\leq (1+\eps)f(S)$ for all subsets $S$. We are interested in characterizing the query-complexity of maximizing $F$ subject to a cardinality constraint $k$ as a function of the error level $\eps > 0$.  We provide both lower and upper bounds: for $\eps > n^{-1/2}$ we show an exponential query-complexity lower bound.  In contrast; when $\eps < {1}/{k}$ or under a stronger bounded curvature assumption; we give constant approximation algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6236-maximization-of-approximately-submodular-functions/bibtex,Thibaut Horel; Yaron Singer

Deep learning (DL) approaches have achieved the state-of-the-art segmentation performance. To exploit the 3D contexts using neural networks; known DL segmentation methods; including 3D convolution; 2D convolution on the planes orthogonal to 2D slices; and LSTM in multiple directions; all suffer incompatibility with the highly anisotropic dimensions in common 3D biomedical images. In this paper; we propose a new DL framework for 3D image segmentation; based on a combination of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN); which are responsible for exploiting the intra-slice and inter-slice contexts; respectively. To our best knowledge; this is the first DL framework for 3D image segmentation that explicitly leverages 3D image anisotropism. Evaluating using a dataset from the ISBI Neuronal Structure Segmentation Challenge and in-house image stacks for 3D fungus segmentation; our approach achieves promising results; comparing to the known DL-based 3D segmentation approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6448-combining-fully-convolutional-and-recurrent-neural-networks-for-3d-biomedical-image-segmentation/bibtex,Jianxu Chen; Lin Yang; Yizhe Zhang; Mark Alber; Danny Z.

In contrast; teaching by demonstration has been less well studied computationally. Here; we develop a novel Bayesian model for teaching by demonstration. Stark differences arise when demonstrators are intentionally teaching a task versus simply performing a task. In two experiments; we show that human participants systematically modify their teaching behavior consistent with the predictions of our model. Further; we show that even standard IRL algorithms benefit when learning from behaviors that are intentionally pedagogical. We conclude by discussing IRL algorithms that can take advantage of intentional pedagogy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6413-showing-versus-doing-teaching-by-demonstration/bibtex,Mark K.

Our methods are the first scalable sampling methods on these manifolds; with the aid of stochastic gradients. Novel dynamics are conceived and 2nd-order integrators are developed. By adopting embedding techniques and the geodesic integrator; the methods do not require a global coordinate system of the manifold and do not involve inner iterations. Synthetic experiments show the validity of the method; and its application to the challenging inference for spherical topic models indicate practical usability and efficiency.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6282-stochastic-gradient-geodesic-mcmc-methods/bibtex,Chang Liu; Jun Zhu; Yang Song

While often effective in practice; it is known that the approximation error can be arbitrarily large.  We propose a new class of bounds on the marginal log-likelihood of directed latent variable models. Our approach relies on random projections to simplify the posterior. In contrast to standard variational methods; our bounds are guaranteed to be tight with high probability. We provide a new approach for learning latent variable models based on optimizing our new bounds on the log-likelihood. We demonstrate empirical improvements on benchmark datasets in vision and language for sigmoid belief networks; where a neural network is used to approximate the posterior.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6259-variational-bayes-on-monte-carlo-steroids/bibtex,Aditya Grover; Stefano Ermon

We propose randomized Newton-type algorithms that exploit \textit{non-uniform} sub-sampling of $\{\nabla^2 f_i(w)\}_{i=1}^{n}$; as well as inexact updates; as means to reduce the computational complexity; and are applicable to a wide range of problems in machine learning. Two non-uniform sampling distributions based on {\it block norm squares} and {\it block partial leverage scores} are considered. Under certain assumptions; we show that our algorithms inherit a linear-quadratic convergence rate in $w$ and achieve a lower computational complexity compared to similar existing methods.  In addition; we show that our algorithms exhibit more robustness and better dependence on problem specific quantities; such as the condition number. We numerically demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms on several real datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6037-sub-sampled-newton-methods-with-non-uniform-sampling/bibtex,Peng Xu; Jiyan Yang; Farbod Roosta-Khorasani; Christopher R?; Michael W.

This dynamics can be described naturally as a coupling of a dual variable accumulating gradients at a given rate $\eta(t)$; and a primal variable obtained as the weighted average of the mirrored dual trajectory; with weights $w(t)$. Using a Lyapunov argument; we give sufficient conditions on $\eta$ and $w$ to achieve a desired convergence rate. As an example; we show that the replicator dynamics (an example of mirror descent on the simplex) can be accelerated using a simple averaging scheme. We then propose an adaptive averaging heuristic which adaptively computes the weights to speed up the decrease of the Lyapunov function. We provide guarantees on adaptive averaging in continuous-time; prove that it preserves the quadratic convergence rate of accelerated first-order methods in discrete-time; and give numerical experiments to compare it with existing heuristics; such as adaptive restarting. The experiments indicate that adaptive averaging performs at least as well as adaptive restarting; with significant improvements in some cases.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6553-adaptive-averaging-in-accelerated-descent-dynamics/bibtex,Walid Krichene; Alexandre Bayen; Peter L.

Simple non-convex optimization algorithms are popular and effective in practice. Despite recent progress in proving various non-convex algorithms converge from a good initial point; it remains unclear why random or arbitrary initialization suffices in practice. We prove that the commonly used non-convex objective function for matrix completion has no spurious local minima \--- all local minima must also be global. Therefore; many popular optimization algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent can provably solve matrix completion with \textit{arbitrary} initialization in polynomial time.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6048-matrix-completion-has-no-spurious-local-minimum/bibtex,Rong Ge; Jason D.

For inference; we use recognition networks to produce local evidence potentials; then combine them with the model distribution using efficient message-passing algorithms. All components are trained simultaneously with a single stochastic variational inference objective.

In this paper; we present conditional generative moment-matching networks (CGMMN); which learn a conditional distribution given some input variables based on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) criterion. The learning is performed by stochastic gradient descent with the gradient calculated by back-propagation. We evaluate CGMMN on a wide range of tasks; including predictive modeling; contextual generation; and Bayesian dark knowledge; which distills knowledge from a Bayesian model by learning a relatively small CGMMN student network.

This is known as the problem of life-long matrix completion; and is widely applied to recommendation system; computer vision; system identification; etc. The challenge is to design provable algorithms tolerant to a large amount of noises; with small sample complexity. In this work; we give algorithms achieving strong guarantee under two realistic noise models. In bounded deterministic noise; an adversary can add any bounded yet unstructured noise to each column. For this problem; we present an algorithm that returns a matrix of a small error; with sample complexity almost as small as the best prior results in the noiseless case. For sparse random noise; where the corrupted columns are sparse and drawn randomly; we give an algorithm that exactly recovers an $\mu_0$-incoherent matrix by probability at least $1-\delta$ with sample complexity as small as $O(\mu_0rn\log(r/\delta))$. This result advances the state-of-the-art work and matches the lower bound in a worst case. We also study the scenario where the hidden matrix lies on a mixture of subspaces and show that the sample complexity can be even smaller. Our proposed algorithms perform well experimentally in both synthetic and real-world datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6580-noise-tolerant-life-long-matrix-completion-via-adaptive-sampling/bibtex,Maria-Florina F.

2016,The Multiscale Laplacian Graph Kernel,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6135-the-multiscale-laplacian-graph-kernel.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6135-the-multiscale-laplacian-graph-kernel,Many real world graphs; such as the graphs of molecules; exhibit structure at multiple different scales; but most existing kernels between graphs are either purely local or purely global in character. In contrast; by building a hierarchy of nested subgraphs; the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG kernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of different scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph kernel; called the Feature Space Laplacian Graph kernel (FLG kernel); which has the property that it can lift a base kernel defined on the vertices of two graphs to a kernel between the graphs. The MLG kernel applies such FLG kernels to subgraphs recursively. To make the MLG kernel computationally feasible; we also introduce a randomized projection procedure; similar to the Nystro ?m method; but for RKHS operators.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6135-the-multiscale-laplacian-graph-kernel/bibtex,Risi Kondor; Horace Pan
2016,Balancing Suspense and Surprise: Timely Decision Making with Endogenous Information Acquisition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6062-balancing-suspense-and-surprise-timely-decision-making-with-endogenous-information-acquisition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6062-balancing-suspense-and-surprise-timely-decision-making-with-endogenous-information-acquisition,We develop a Bayesian model for decision-making under time pressure with endogenous information acquisition. In our model; the decision-maker decides when to observe (costly) information by sampling an underlying continuous-time stochastic process (time series) that conveys information about the potential occurrence/non-occurrence of an adverse event which will terminate the decision-making process. In her attempt to predict the occurrence of the adverse event; the decision-maker follows a policy that determines when to acquire information from the time series (continuation); and when to stop acquiring information and make a final prediction (stopping). We show that the optimal policy has a "rendezvous" structure; i.e. a structure in which whenever a new information sample is gathered from the time series; the optimal "date" for acquiring the next sample becomes computable. The optimal interval between two information samples balances a trade-off between the decision maker?s "surprise"; i.e. the drift in her posterior belief after observing new information; and "suspense"; i.e. the probability that the adverse event occurs in the time interval between two information samples. Moreover; we characterize the continuation and stopping regions in the decision-maker?s state-space; and show that they depend not only on the decision-maker?s beliefs; but also on the "context"; i.e. the current realization of the time series.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6062-balancing-suspense-and-surprise-timely-decision-making-with-endogenous-information-acquisition/bibtex,Ahmed M.

2016,Combinatorial semi-bandit with known covariance,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6137-combinatorial-semi-bandit-with-known-covariance.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6137-combinatorial-semi-bandit-with-known-covariance,The combinatorial stochastic semi-bandit problem is an extension of the classical multi-armed bandit problem in which an algorithm pulls more than one arm at each stage and the rewards of all pulled arms are revealed. One difference with the single arm variant is that the dependency structure of the arms is crucial. Previous works on this setting either used a worst-case approach or imposed independence of the arms. We introduce a way to quantify the dependency structure of the problem and design an algorithm that adapts to it. The algorithm is based on linear regression and the analysis uses techniques from the linear bandit literature. By comparing its performance to a new lower bound; we prove that it is optimal; up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the number of arms pulled.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6137-combinatorial-semi-bandit-with-known-covariance/bibtex,R?my Degenne; Vianney Perchet
2016,Stochastic Gradient MCMC with Stale Gradients,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6359-stochastic-gradient-mcmc-with-stale-gradients.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6359-stochastic-gradient-mcmc-with-stale-gradients,Stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) has played an important role in large-scale Bayesian learning; with well-developed theoretical convergence properties. In such applications of SG-MCMC; it is becoming increasingly popular to employ distributed systems; where stochastic gradients are computed based on some outdated parameters; yielding what are termed stale gradients. While stale gradients could be directly used in SG-MCMC; their impact on convergence properties has not been well studied. In this paper we develop theory to show that while the bias and MSE of an SG-MCMC algorithm depend on the staleness of stochastic gradients; its estimation variance (relative to the expected estimate; based on a prescribed number of samples) is independent of it. In a simple Bayesian distributed system with SG-MCMC; where stale gradients are computed asynchronously by a set of workers; our theory indicates a linear speedup on the decrease of estimation variance w.r.t. the number of workers. Experiments on synthetic data and deep neural networks validate our theory; demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of SG-MCMC with stale gradients.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6359-stochastic-gradient-mcmc-with-stale-gradients/bibtex,Changyou Chen; Nan Ding; Chunyuan Li; Yizhe Zhang; Lawrence Carin

However; flexible monotonic functions are computationally challenging to learn beyond a few features. We break through this barrier by learning ensembles of monotonic calibrated interpolated look-up tables (lattices). A key contribution is an automated algorithm for selecting feature subsets for the ensemble base models.  We demonstrate that compared to random forests; these ensembles produce similar or better accuracy; while providing guaranteed monotonicity consistent with prior knowledge; smaller model size and faster evaluation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6377-fast-and-flexible-monotonic-functions-with-ensembles-of-lattices/bibtex,Mahdi Milani Fard; Kevin Canini; Andrew Cotter; Jan Pfeifer; Maya Gupta

We present a sophisticated method for automatically searching for an appropriate kernel from an infinite space of potential choices. Previous efforts in this direction have focused on traversing a kernel grammar; only examining the data via computation of marginal likelihood. Our proposed search method is based on Bayesian optimization in model space; where we reason about model evidence as a function to be maximized. We explicitly reason about the data distribution and how it induces similarity between potential model choices in terms of the explanations they can offer for observed data. In this light; we construct a novel kernel between models to explain a given dataset. Our method is capable of finding a model that explains a given dataset well without any human assistance; often with fewer computations of model evidence than previous approaches; a claim we demonstrate empirically.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6466-bayesian-optimization-for-automated-model-selection/bibtex,Gustavo Malkomes; Charles Schaff; Roman Garnett

In general terms; two main approaches have been developed: one based on penalized regularization methods; and one based on trimming functions. In this work; we present a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of a variant of the classical quadratic k-means algorithm; the robust k-means; which borrows ideas from outlier detection in regression. We show that two outliers in a dataset are enough to breakdown this clustering procedure. However; if we focus on ?well-structured? datasets; then robust k-means can recover the underlying cluster structure in spite of the outliers. Finally; we show that; with slight modifications; the most general non-asymptotic results for consistency of quadratic k-means remain valid for this robust variant.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6126-robust-k-means-a-theoretical-revisit/bibtex,ALEXANDROS GEORGOGIANNIS
2016,Regret Bounds for Non-decomposable Metrics with Missing Labels,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6178-regret-bounds-for-non-decomposable-metrics-with-missing-labels.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6178-regret-bounds-for-non-decomposable-metrics-with-missing-labels,We consider the problem of recommending relevant labels (items) for a given data point (user). In particular; we are interested in the practically important setting where the evaluation is with respect to non-decomposable (over labels) performance metrics like the $F_1$ measure; \emph{and} training data has missing labels. To this end; we propose a generic framework that given a performance metric $\Psi$; can devise a regularized objective function and a threshold such that all the values in the predicted score vector above and only above the threshold are selected to be positive.  We show that the regret or generalization error in the given metric $\Psi$ is bounded ultimately by estimation error of certain underlying parameters. In particular; we derive regret bounds under three popular settings: a) collaborative filtering; b) multilabel classification; and c) PU (positive-unlabeled) learning.  For each of the above problems; we can obtain precise non-asymptotic regret bound which is small even when a large fraction of labels is missing. Our empirical results on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate that by explicitly modeling for missing labels and optimizing the desired performance metric; our algorithm indeed achieves significantly better performance (like $F_1$ score) when compared to methods that do not model missing label information carefully.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6178-regret-bounds-for-non-decomposable-metrics-with-missing-labels/bibtex,Nagarajan Natarajan; Prateek Jain

However; it is usually assumed that the distribution of the observations conditioned on the latent variables is either discrete or belongs to a parametric family. In this paper; we study the estimation of an $m$-state hidden Markov model (HMM) with only smoothness assumptions; such as H\"olderian conditions; on the emission densities. By leveraging some recent advances in continuous linear algebra and numerical analysis; we develop a computationally efficient spectral algorithm for learning nonparametric HMMs. Our technique is based on computing an SVD on nonparametric estimates of density functions by viewing them as \emph{continuous matrices}. We derive sample complexity bounds via concentration results for nonparametric density estimation and novel perturbation theory results for continuous matrices. We implement our method using Chebyshev polynomial approximations. Our method is competitive with other baselines on synthetic and real problems and is also very computationally efficient.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6086-learning-hmms-with-nonparametric-emissions-via-spectral-decompositions-of-continuous-matrices/bibtex,Kirthevasan Kandasamy; Maruan Al-Shedivat; Eric P.

(MI) to improve recurrent neural networks (RNNs). MI changes the way of how the information flow gets integrated in the computational building block of an RNN; while introducing almost no extra parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN models; including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6215-on-multiplicative-integration-with-recurrent-neural-networks/bibtex,Yuhuai Wu; Saizheng Zhang; Ying Zhang; Yoshua Bengio; Ruslan R.

As a result; there is a large body of literature focused on consistent model selection. However; scientists are often interested in understanding uncertainty associated with the estimated parameters; which current literature has not addressed thoroughly. In this paper; we propose a novel estimator for edge parameters for pairwise graphical models based on Hyv\"arinen scoring rule. Hyv\"arinen scoring rule is especially useful in cases where the normalizing constant cannot be  obtained efficiently in a closed form. We prove that the estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically Normal. This result allows us to construct confidence intervals for edge parameters; as well as; hypothesis tests.  We establish our results under conditions that are typically assumed in the literature for consistent estimation. However; we do not require that the estimator consistently recovers the graph structure. In particular; we prove that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator is robust to model selection mistakes and uniformly valid for a large number of data-generating processes. We illustrate validity of our estimator through extensive simulation studies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6530-statistical-inference-for-pairwise-graphical-models-using-score-matching/bibtex,Ming Yu; Mladen Kolar; Varun Gupta

Intuitively; the goodness-of-fit of a metric space to a tree depends on its inherent treeness; as well as other metric properties such as intrinsic dimension. Existing algorithms for embedding metric spaces into tree metrics provide distortion bounds depending on cardinality. Because cardinality is a simple property of any set; we argue that such bounds do not fully capture the rich structure endowed by the metric. We consider an embedding of a metric space into a tree proposed by Gromov. By proving a stability result; we obtain an improved additive distortion bound depending only on the hyperbolicity and doubling dimension of the metric. We observe that Gromov's method is dual to the well-known single linkage hierarchical clustering (SLHC) method. By means of this duality; we are able to transport our results to the setting of SLHC; where such additive distortion bounds were previously unknown.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6431-improved-error-bounds-for-tree-representations-of-metric-spaces/bibtex,Samir Chowdhury; Facundo M?moli; Zane T.

2016,Can Peripheral Representations Improve Clutter Metrics on Complex Scenes?,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6404-can-peripheral-representations-improve-clutter-metrics-on-complex-scenes.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6404-can-peripheral-representations-improve-clutter-metrics-on-complex-scenes,Previous studies have proposed image-based clutter measures that correlate with human search times and/or eye movements. However; most models do not take into account the fact that the effects of clutter interact with the foveated nature of the human visual system: visual clutter further from the fovea has an increasing detrimental influence on perception. Here; we introduce a new foveated clutter model to predict the detrimental effects in target search utilizing a forced fixation search task. We use Feature Congestion (Rosenholtz et al.) as our non foveated clutter model; and we stack a peripheral architecture on top of Feature Congestion for our foveated model. We introduce the Peripheral Integration Feature Congestion (PIFC) coefficient; as a fundamental ingredient of our model that modulates clutter as a non-linear gain contingent on eccentricity. We finally show that Foveated Feature Congestion (FFC) clutter scores (r(44) = ?0.82 ? 0.04; p < 0.0001) correlate better with target detection (hit rate) than regular Feature Congestion (r(44) = ?0.19 ? 0.13; p = 0.0774) in forced fixation search; and we extend foveation to other clutter models showing stronger correlations in all cases. Thus; our model allows us to enrich clutter perception research by computing fixation specific clutter maps.

In addition to transcribing text from challenging images; our method performs fine-grained instance segmentation of characters. We show that our model is more robust to both affine transformations and non-affine deformations compared to previous approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6071-generative-shape-models-joint-text-recognition-and-segmentation-with-very-little-training-data/bibtex,Xinghua Lou; Ken Kansky; Wolfgang Lehrach; CC Laan; Bhaskara Marthi; D.

2016,Object based Scene Representations using Fisher Scores of Local Subspace Projections,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6343-object-based-scene-representations-using-fisher-scores-of-local-subspace-projections.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6343-object-based-scene-representations-using-fisher-scores-of-local-subspace-projections,Several works have shown that deep CNN classifiers can be easily transferred across datasets; e.g. the transfer of a CNN trained to recognize objects on ImageNET to an object detector on Pascal VOC. Less clear; however; is the ability of CNNs to transfer knowledge across tasks. A common example of such transfer is the problem of scene classification that should leverage localized object detections to recognize holistic visual concepts. While this problem is currently addressed with Fisher vector representations; these are now shown ineffective for the high-dimensional and highly non-linear features extracted by modern CNNs. It is argued that this is mostly due to the reliance on a model; the Gaussian mixture of diagonal covariances; which has a very limited ability to capture the second order statistics of CNN features. This problem is addressed by the adoption of a better model; the mixture of factor analyzers (MFA); which approximates the non-linear data manifold by a collection of local subspaces. The Fisher score with respect to the MFA (MFA-FS) is derived and proposed as an image representation for holistic image classifiers. Extensive experiments show that the MFA-FS has state of the art performance for object-to-scene transfer and this transfer actually  outperforms the training of a scene CNN from a large scene dataset. The two representations are also shown to be complementary; in the sense that their combination outperforms each of the representations by itself. When combined; they produce a state of the art scene classifier.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6343-object-based-scene-representations-using-fisher-scores-of-local-subspace-projections/bibtex,Mandar D.

Previous empirical studies have shown oracles abstaining on difficult queries until accumulating enough information to make label decisions. We formalize this phenomenon with an ?oracle epiphany model? and analyze active learning query complexity under such oracles for both the realizable and the agnos- tic cases. Our analysis shows that active learning is possible with oracle epiphany; but incurs an additional cost depending on when the epiphany happens. Our results suggest new; principled active learning approaches with realistic oracles.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6155-active-learning-with-oracle-epiphany/bibtex,Tzu-Kuo Huang; Lihong Li; Ara Vartanian; Saleema Amershi; Xiaojin Zhu

In particular; the availability of large-scale data from social networks and sensor networks offers an unprecedented opportunity to predict state-changing events at the individual level. Examples of such events include disease transmission; opinion transition in elections; and rumor propagation. Unlike previous research focusing on the collective effects of social systems; this study makes efficient inferences at the individual level. In order to cope with dynamic interactions among a large number of individuals; we introduce the stochastic kinetic model to capture adaptive transition probabilities and propose an efficient variational inference algorithm the complexity of which grows linearly ? rather than exponentially? with the number of individuals. To validate this method; we have performed epidemic-dynamics experiments on wireless sensor network data collected from more than ten thousand people over three years. The proposed algorithm was used to track disease transmission and predict the probability of infection for each individual. Our results demonstrate that this method is more efficient than sampling while nonetheless achieving high accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6453-using-social-dynamics-to-make-individual-predictions-variational-inference-with-a-stochastic-kinetic-model/bibtex,Zhen Xu; Wen Dong; Sargur N.

The network is composed of multiple layers of convolution and deconvolution operators; learning end-to-end mappings from corrupted images to the original ones. The convolutional layers act as the feature extractor; which capture the abstraction of image contents while eliminating noises/corruptions. Deconvolutional layers are then used to recover the image details. We propose to symmetrically link convolutional and deconvolutional layers with skip-layer connections; with which the training converges much faster and attains a higher-quality local optimum. First; the skip connections allow the signal to be back-propagated to bottom layers directly; and thus tackles the problem of gradient vanishing; making training deep networks easier and achieving restoration performance gains consequently. Second; these skip connections pass image details from convolutional layers to deconvolutional layers; which is beneficial in recovering the original image. Significantly; with the large capacity; we can handle different levels of noises using a single model. Experimental results show that our network achieves better performance than recent state-of-the-art methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6172-image-restoration-using-very-deep-convolutional-encoder-decoder-networks-with-symmetric-skip-connections/bibtex,Xiaojiao Mao; Chunhua Shen; Yu-Bin Yang

We first extend the investigation to multiclass categorization: we prove that in this case learnability is equivalent to compression of logarithmic sample size and that the uniform convergence property implies compression of constant size. We use the compressibility-learnability equivalence to show that (i) for multiclass categorization; PAC and agnostic PAC learnability are equivalent; and (ii) to derive a compactness theorem for learnability. We then consider supervised learning under general loss functions: we show that in this case; in order to maintain the compressibility-learnability equivalence; it is necessary to consider an approximate variant of compression. We use it to show that PAC and agnostic PAC are not equivalent; even when the loss function has only three values.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6490-supervised-learning-through-the-lens-of-compression/bibtex,Ofir David; Shay Moran; Amir Yehudayoff

To address this shortcoming; over a decade ago; Burer and Monteiro proposed to solve SDP's with few equality constraints via rank-restricted; non-convex surrogates. Remarkably; for some applications; local optimization methods seem to converge to global optima of these non-convex surrogates reliably. Although some theory supports this empirical success; a complete explanation of it remains an open question. In this paper; we consider a class of SDP's which includes applications such as max-cut; community detection in the stochastic block model; robust PCA; phase retrieval and synchronization of rotations. We show that the low-rank Burer-Monteiro formulation of SDP's in that class almost never has any spurious local optima.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6517-the-non-convex-burer-monteiro-approach-works-on-smooth-semidefinite-programs/bibtex,Nicolas Boumal; Vlad Voroninski; Afonso Bandeira

We show applications of our approach to computing the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of any $n\times d$ matrix; using one pass over the stream of its rows. Our solution uses coresets: a scaled subset of the $n$ rows that approximates their sum of squared distances to \emph{every} $k$-dimensional \emph{affine} subspace. An open theoretical problem has been to compute such a coreset that is independent of both $n$ and $d$. An open practical problem has been to compute a non-trivial approximation to the PCA of very large but sparse databases such as the Wikipedia document-term matrix in a reasonable time. We answer both of these questions affirmatively. Our main technical result is a new framework for deterministic coreset constructions based on a reduction to the problem of counting items in a stream.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6596-dimensionality-reduction-of-massive-sparse-datasets-using-coresets/bibtex,Dan Feldman; Mikhail Volkov; Daniela Rus

In the present paper; we consider the problem of estimating cosine similarities when the projected data undergo scalar quantization to $b$ bits. We here argue that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is a principled approach to deal with the non-linearity resulting from quantization; and subsequently study its computational and statistical properties. A specific focus is on the on the trade-off between bit depth and the number of projections given a fixed budget of bits for storage or transmission. Along the way; we also touch upon the existence of a qualitative counterpart to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma in the presence of quantization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6492-quantized-random-projections-and-non-linear-estimation-of-cosine-similarity/bibtex,Ping Li; Michael Mitzenmacher; Martin Slawski

To examine the underlying computational principles that guide different learning behavior in an uncertain environment; we compared an R-W model and a Bayesian approach in a visual search task with different volatility levels. Both R-W model and the Bayesian approach reflected an individual's estimation of the environmental volatility; and there is a strong correlation between the learning rate in R-W model and the belief of stationarity in the Bayesian approach in different volatility conditions. In a low volatility condition; R-W model indicates that learning rate positively correlates with lose-shift rate; but not choice optimality (inverted U shape). The Bayesian approach indicates that the belief of environmental stationarity positively correlates with choice optimality; but not lose-shift rate (inverted U shape). In addition; we showed that comparing to Expert learners; individuals with high lose-shift rate (sub-optimal learners) had significantly higher learning rate estimated from R-W model and lower belief of stationarity from the Bayesian model.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6409-learning-under-uncertainty-a-comparison-between-r-w-and-bayesian-approach/bibtex,He Huang; Martin Paulus
2016,Bi-Objective Online Matching and Submodular  Allocations,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6085-bi-objective-online-matching-and-submodular-allocations.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6085-bi-objective-online-matching-and-submodular-allocations,Online allocation problems have been widely studied due to their numerous practical applications (particularly to Internet advertising); as well as considerable theoretical interest. The main challenge in such problems is making assignment decisions in the face of uncertainty about future input; effective algorithms need to predict which constraints are most likely to bind; and learn the balance between short-term gain and the value of long-term resource availability.  In many important applications; the algorithm designer is faced with multiple objectives to optimize. In particular; in online advertising it is fairly common to optimize multiple metrics; such as clicks; conversions; and impressions; as well as other metrics which may be largely uncorrelated such as ?share of voice?; and ?buyer surplus?. While there has been considerable work on multi-objective offline optimization (when the entire input is known in advance); very little is known about the online case; particularly in the case of adversarial input. In this paper; we give the first results for bi-objective online submodular optimization; providing almost matching upper and lower bounds for allocating items to agents with two submodular value functions. We also study practically relevant special cases of this problem related to Internet advertising; and obtain improved results.

Almost all prior approaches address this challenge by attempting to learn the possible transformations that relate the different views of a person from a training corpora. Then; they utilize these transformation patterns for matching a query image to those in a gallery image bank at test time. This necessitates learning good feature representations of the images and having a robust feature matching technique. Deep learning approaches; such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); simultaneously do both and have shown great promise recently. In this work; we propose two CNN-based architectures for Person Re-Identification. In the first; given a pair of images; we extract feature maps from these images via multiple stages of convolution and pooling. A novel inexact matching technique then matches pixels in the first representation with those of the second. Furthermore; we search across a wider region in the second representation for matching. Our novel matching technique allows us to tackle the challenges posed by large viewpoint variations; illumination changes or partial occlusions. Our approach shows a promising performance and requires only about half the parameters as a current state-of-the-art technique. Nonetheless; it also suffers from false matches at times. In order to mitigate this issue; we propose a fused architecture that combines our inexact matching pipeline with a state-of-the-art exact matching technique. We observe substantial gains with the fused model over the current state-of-the-art on multiple challenging datasets of varying sizes; with gains of up to about 21%.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6367-deep-neural-networks-with-inexact-matching-for-person-re-identification/bibtex,Arulkumar Subramaniam; Moitreya Chatterjee; Anurag Mittal
2016,Finite Sample Prediction and Recovery Bounds for Ordinal Embedding,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6554-finite-sample-prediction-and-recovery-bounds-for-ordinal-embedding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6554-finite-sample-prediction-and-recovery-bounds-for-ordinal-embedding,The goal of ordinal embedding is to represent items as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space given a set of constraints like ``item $i$ is closer to item $j$ than item $k$''.  Ordinal   constraints like this often come from human judgments.  The classic approach to solving this problem is known as non-metric multidimensional scaling.  To account for errors and variation in judgments; we consider the noisy situation in which the given constraints are independently corrupted by reversing the correct constraint with some probability. The ordinal embedding problem has been studied for decades; but most past work pays little attention to the question of whether accurate embedding is possible; apart from empirical studies.  This paper shows that under a generative data model it is possible to learn the correct embedding from noisy distance comparisons.  In establishing this fundamental result; the paper makes several new contributions. First; we derive prediction error bounds for embedding from noisy distance comparisons by exploiting the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points in $\R^d$ is at most $d+2$. These bounds characterize how well a learned embedding predicts new comparative judgments. Second; we show that the underlying embedding can be recovered by solving a simple convex optimization.  This result is highly non-trivial since we show that the linear map corresponding to distance comparisons is non-invertible; but there exists a nonlinear map that is invertible. Third; two new algorithms for ordinal embedding are proposed and evaluated in experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6554-finite-sample-prediction-and-recovery-bounds-for-ordinal-embedding/bibtex,Lalit Jain; Kevin G.

Then; we introduce the notion of the local stability of parametric feature mapping and  parameter transfer learnability; and thereby derive a learning bound for parameter transfer algorithms. As an application of parameter transfer learning; we discuss the performance of sparse coding in self-taught learning. Although self-taught learning algorithms with plentiful unlabeled data often show excellent empirical performance; their theoretical analysis has not been studied. In this paper; we also provide the first theoretical learning bound for self-taught learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6136-learning-bound-for-parameter-transfer-learning/bibtex,Wataru Kumagai

In recent years; several algorithms have been proposed to learn from positive-unlabeled data; however; many of these contributions remain theoretical; performing poorly on real high-dimensional data that is typically contaminated with noise. We build on this previous work to develop two practical classification algorithms that explicitly model the noise in the positive labels and utilize univariate transforms built on discriminative classifiers. We prove that these univariate transforms preserve the class prior; enabling estimation in the univariate space and avoiding kernel density estimation for high-dimensional data. The theoretical development and parametric and nonparametric algorithms proposed here constitute an important step towards wide-spread use of robust classification algorithms for positive-unlabeled data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6168-estimating-the-class-prior-and-posterior-from-noisy-positives-and-unlabeled-data/bibtex,Shantanu Jain; Martha White; Predrag Radivojac

They have recently gained prominence in several applications that rely on diverse subsets. However; their applicability to large problems is still limited due to O(N^3) complexity of core tasks such as sampling and learning. We enable efficient sampling and learning for DPPs by introducing KronDPP; a DPP model whose kernel matrix decomposes as a tensor product of multiple smaller kernel matrices. This decomposition immediately enables fast exact sampling. But contrary to what one may expect; leveraging the Kronecker product structure for speeding up DPP learning turns out to be more difficult. We overcome this challenge; and derive batch and stochastic optimization algorithms for efficiently learning the parameters of a KronDPP.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6296-kronecker-determinantal-point-processes/bibtex,Zelda E.

2016,Global Analysis of Expectation Maximization for Mixtures of Two Gaussians,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6047-global-analysis-of-expectation-maximization-for-mixtures-of-two-gaussians.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6047-global-analysis-of-expectation-maximization-for-mixtures-of-two-gaussians,Expectation Maximization (EM) is among the most popular algorithms for estimating parameters of statistical models.  However; EM; which is an iterative algorithm based on the maximum likelihood principle; is generally only guaranteed to find stationary points of the likelihood objective; and these points may be far from any maximizer.  This article addresses this disconnect between the statistical principles behind EM and its algorithmic properties.  Specifically; it provides a global analysis of EM for specific models in which the observations comprise an i.i.d. sample from a mixture of two Gaussians.  This is achieved by (i) studying the sequence of parameters from idealized execution of EM in the infinite sample limit; and fully characterizing the limit points of the sequence in terms of the initial parameters; and then (ii) based on this convergence analysis; establishing statistical consistency (or lack thereof) for the actual sequence of parameters produced by EM.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6047-global-analysis-of-expectation-maximization-for-mixtures-of-two-gaussians/bibtex,Ji Xu; Daniel J.

However; for high-dimensional data (D >> N); it is more natural to partition the data by features. We propose an algorithm to distributed sparse regression when the data is partitioned by features rather than samples. Our approach allows the user to tailor our general method to various distributed computing platforms by trading-off the total amount of data (in bits) sent over the communication network and the number of rounds of communication. We show that an implementation of our approach is capable of solving L1-regularized L2 regression problems with millions of features in minutes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6187-feature-distributed-sparse-regression-a-screen-and-clean-approach/bibtex,Jiyan Yang; Michael W.

We approach the problem of monocular depth estimation by using a neural network to produce a mid-level representation that summarizes these cues. This network is trained to characterize local scene geometry by predicting; at every image location; depth derivatives of different orders; orientations and scales. However; instead of a single estimate for each derivative; the network outputs probability distributions that allow it to express confidence about some coefficients; and ambiguity about others. Scene depth is then estimated by harmonizing this overcomplete set of network predictions; using a globalization procedure that finds a single consistent depth map that best matches all the local derivative distributions. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through evaluation on the NYU v2 depth data set.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6510-depth-from-a-single-image-by-harmonizing-overcomplete-local-network-predictions/bibtex,Ayan Chakrabarti; Jingyu Shao; Greg Shakhnarovich

Standard exact inference techniques such as variable elimination and belief propagation do not apply to these models because the latent variables have countably infinite support. As a result; approximations such as truncation or MCMC are employed. We present the first exact inference algorithms for a class of models with latent count variables by developing a novel representation of countably infinite factors as probability generating functions; and then performing variable elimination with generating functions. Our approach is exact; runs in pseudo-polynomial time; and is much faster than existing approximate techniques. It leads to better parameter estimates for problems in population ecology by avoiding error introduced by approximate likelihood computations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6587-probabilistic-inference-with-generating-functions-for-poisson-latent-variable-models/bibtex,Kevin Winner; Daniel R.

Two typical tasks; causal sensor placement and covariate selection; are correspondingly formulated into cardinality constrained directed information maximizations. To attack the NP-hard problems; we show that the first problem is submodular while not necessarily monotonic. And the second one is ``nearly'' submodular.  To substantiate the idea of approximate submodularity; we introduce a novel quantity; namely submodularity index (SmI); for general set functions. Moreover; we show that based on SmI; greedy algorithm has performance guarantee for the maximization of possibly non-monotonic and non-submodular functions; justifying its usage for a much broader class of problems. We evaluate the theoretical results with several case studies; and also illustrate the application of the subset selection to causal structure learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6384-causal-meets-submodular-subset-selection-with-directed-information/bibtex,Yuxun Zhou; Costas J.

We propose metrics for measuring the robustness of a neural net and devise a novel algorithm for approximating these metrics based on an encoding of robustness as a linear program. We show how our metrics can be used to evaluate the robustness of deep neural nets with experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our algorithm generates more informative estimates of robustness metrics compared to estimates based on existing algorithms. Furthermore; we show how existing approaches to improving robustness ?overfit? to adversarial examples generated using a specific algorithm. Finally; we show that our techniques can be used to additionally improve neural net robustness both according to the metrics that we propose; but also according to previously proposed metrics.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6339-measuring-neural-net-robustness-with-constraints/bibtex,Osbert Bastani; Yani Ioannou; Leonidas Lampropoulos; Dimitrios Vytiniotis; Aditya Nori; Antonio Criminisi

If the data has intrinsic dimension d; it is often impossible to obtain an isometric embedding in d dimensions; but possible in s > d dimensions. Yet; most geometry preserving algorithms cannot do the latter. This paper proposes an embedding algorithm that overcomes this problem. The algorithm directly computes; for any data embedding Y; a distortion loss(Y); and iteratively updates Y in order to decrease it. The distortion measure we propose is based on the push-forward Riemannian metric associated with the coordinates Y. The experiments confirm the superiority of our algorithm in obtaining low distortion embeddings.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6535-nearly-isometric-embedding-by-relaxation/bibtex,James McQueen; Marina Meila; Dominique Joncas
2016,Long-term Causal Effects via Behavioral Game Theory,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6059-long-term-causal-effects-via-behavioral-game-theory.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6059-long-term-causal-effects-via-behavioral-game-theory,Planned experiments are the gold standard in reliably comparing the causal effect of switching from a baseline policy to a new policy. % One critical shortcoming of classical experimental methods; however; is that they typically do not take into account the dynamic nature of response to policy changes. For instance; in an experiment where we seek to understand the effects of a new ad pricing policy on auction revenue; agents may adapt their bidding in response to the experimental pricing changes. Thus; causal effects of the new pricing policy after such adaptation period; the {\em long-term causal effects}; are not captured by the classical methodology even though they clearly are more indicative of the value of the new policy. %  Here; we formalize a framework to define and estimate long-term causal effects of   policy changes in multiagent economies.  Central to our approach is behavioral game theory; which we leverage   to formulate the ignorability assumptions that are necessary for causal inference.  Under such assumptions we estimate long-term causal effects through a latent space approach; where a behavioral model of how agents act conditional on their latent behaviors is combined with a temporal model of how behaviors evolve over time.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6059-long-term-causal-effects-via-behavioral-game-theory/bibtex,Panagiotis Toulis; David C.

We suggest a new estimator that is computationally efficient and requires a number of samples that is near-optimal with respect to previously established information theoretic lower-bound. Our statistical estimator has a physical interpretation in terms of "interaction screening". The estimator is consistent and is efficiently implemented using convex optimization. We prove that with appropriate regularization; the estimator recovers the underlying graph using a number of samples that is logarithmic in the system size p and exponential in the maximum coupling-intensity and maximum node-degree.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6375-interaction-screening-efficient-and-sample-optimal-learning-of-ising-models/bibtex,Marc Vuffray; Sidhant Misra; Andrey Lokhov; Michael Chertkov

Our work is along the line of the Wirtinger flow (WF) approach \citet{candes2015phase}; which solves the problem by minimizing a nonconvex loss function via a gradient algorithm and can be shown to converge to a global optimal point under good initialization. In contrast to the smooth loss function used in WF; we adopt a nonsmooth but lower-order loss function; and design a gradient-like algorithm (referred to as reshaped-WF). We show that for random Gaussian measurements; reshaped-WF enjoys geometric convergence to a global optimal point as long as the number $m$ of measurements is at the order of $\cO(n)$; where $n$ is the dimension of the unknown $\bx$. This improves the sample complexity of WF; and achieves  the same sample complexity as truncated-WF \citet{chen2015solving} but without truncation at gradient step. Furthermore; reshaped-WF costs less computationally than WF; and runs faster numerically than both WF and truncated-WF. Bypassing higher-order variables in the loss function and truncations in the gradient loop; analysis of reshaped-WF is simplified.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6319-reshaped-wirtinger-flow-for-solving-quadratic-system-of-equations/bibtex,Huishuai Zhang; Yingbin Liang

We demonstrate that max-sum inference in the DRMM yields an algorithm that exactly reproduces the operations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNs); providing a first principles derivation. Our framework provides new insights into the successes and shortcomings of DCNs as well as a principled route to their improvement. DRMM training via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a powerful alternative to DCN back-propagation; and initial training results are promising. Classification based on the DRMM and other variants outperforms DCNs in supervised digit classification; training 2-3x faster while achieving similar accuracy. Moreover; the DRMM is applicable to semi-supervised and unsupervised learning tasks; achieving results that are state-of-the-art in several categories on the MNIST benchmark and comparable to state of the art on the CIFAR10 benchmark.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6231-a-probabilistic-framework-for-deep-learning/bibtex,Ankit B.

2016,Improved Dropout for Shallow and Deep Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6561-improved-dropout-for-shallow-and-deep-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6561-improved-dropout-for-shallow-and-deep-learning,Dropout has been witnessed with great success in training deep neural networks by independently   zeroing  out the outputs of neurons at random. It has also received a surge of interest for shallow learning; e.g.; logistic regression.  However; the independent  sampling for dropout could be suboptimal for the sake of convergence. In this paper; we propose to use multinomial  sampling for dropout; i.e.; sampling features or neurons according to  a multinomial distribution with different probabilities for different features/neurons. To exhibit the optimal dropout probabilities; we analyze the shallow learning with multinomial  dropout and establish the risk bound for stochastic optimization. By minimizing a sampling dependent factor in the risk bound; we obtain a distribution-dependent dropout with sampling probabilities dependent on the second order statistics of the data distribution. To tackle the issue of evolving  distribution of neurons in deep learning; we propose an efficient adaptive  dropout (named \textbf{evolutional dropout}) that computes the sampling probabilities on-the-fly from a mini-batch of examples. Empirical studies on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed dropouts achieve  not only much faster convergence and  but also a smaller testing error than the standard dropout.  For example; on the CIFAR-100 data; the evolutional  dropout achieves relative improvements  over 10\% on the prediction performance and over 50\% on the convergence speed compared to the standard dropout.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6561-improved-dropout-for-shallow-and-deep-learning/bibtex,Zhe Li; Boqing Gong; Tianbao Yang

We give new data-dependent margin guarantees for structured prediction for a very wide family of loss functions and a general family of hypotheses; with an arbitrary factor graph decomposition. These are the tightest margin bounds known for both standard multi-class and general structured prediction problems.  Our guarantees are expressed in terms of a data-dependent complexity measure; \emph{factor graph complexity}; which we show can be estimated from data and bounded in terms of familiar quantities for several commonly used hypothesis sets; and a sparsity measure for features and graphs. Our proof techniques include generalizations of Talagrand's contraction lemma that can be of independent interest. We further extend our theory by leveraging the principle of Voted Risk Minimization (VRM) and show that learning is possible even with complex factor graphs.  We present new learning bounds for this advanced setting; which we use to devise two new algorithms; \emph{Voted Conditional Random Field} (VCRF) and \emph{Voted Structured Boosting} (StructBoost). These algorithms can make use of complex features and factor graphs and yet benefit from favorable learning guarantees. We also report the results of experiments with VCRF on several datasets to validate our theory.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6485-structured-prediction-theory-based-on-factor-graph-complexity/bibtex,Corinna Cortes; Vitaly Kuznetsov; Mehryar Mohri; Scott Yang

Recently; theoretical analysis of Nystr\"{o}m KRR; including generalization bound and convergence rate; has been established based on  reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with the symmetric positive semi-definite kernel. However; in real world applications; RKHS is not always  optimal  and  kernel function is not necessary to be  symmetric or positive semi-definite.  In this paper; we consider  the generalized Nystr\"{o}m  kernel regression (GNKR) with $\ell_2$ coefficient regularization; where the kernel just requires the continuity and boundedness.  Error analysis is provided to characterize its generalization performance  and the column norm sampling is introduced to construct the refined hypothesis space. In particular;  the fast learning rate with polynomial decay is reached for the GNKR. Experimental analysis demonstrates the satisfactory performance of GNKR with the column norm sampling.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6602-error-analysis-of-generalized-nystrom-kernel-regression/bibtex,Hong Chen; Haifeng Xia; Heng Huang; Weidong Cai

In order to enforce consistency; classical approaches utilize consistency potentials or encode constraints over feasible instances. Unfortunately this comes at the price of a serious computational bottleneck. In this paper we suggest to tackle consistency by incorporating constraints on beliefs.

2016,Geometric Dirichlet Means Algorithm for topic inference,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6332-geometric-dirichlet-means-algorithm-for-topic-inference.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6332-geometric-dirichlet-means-algorithm-for-topic-inference,We propose a geometric algorithm for topic learning and inference that is built on the convex geometry of topics arising from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and its nonparametric extensions. To this end we study the optimization of a geometric loss function; which is a surrogate to the LDA's likelihood. Our method involves a fast optimization based weighted clustering procedure augmented with geometric corrections; which overcomes the computational and statistical inefficiencies encountered by other techniques based on Gibbs sampling and variational inference; while achieving the accuracy comparable to that of a Gibbs sampler. The topic estimates produced by our method are shown to be statistically consistent under some conditions. The algorithm is evaluated with extensive experiments on simulated and real data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6332-geometric-dirichlet-means-algorithm-for-topic-inference/bibtex,Mikhail Yurochkin; XuanLong Nguyen
2016,Hypothesis Testing in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Applications in Alzheimer&#39;s Disease,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6209-hypothesis-testing-in-unsupervised-domain-adaptation-with-applications-in-alzheimers-disease.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6209-hypothesis-testing-in-unsupervised-domain-adaptation-with-applications-in-alzheimers-disease,Consider samples from two different data sources $\{\mathbf{x_s^i}\} \sim P_{\rm source}$ and $\{\mathbf{x_t^i}\} \sim P_{\rm target}$. We only observe their transformed versions $h(\mathbf{x_s^i})$ and $g(\mathbf{x_t^i})$; for some known function class $h(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$. Our goal is to perform a statistical test checking if $P_{\rm source}$ = $P_{\rm target}$ while removing the distortions induced by the transformations. This problem is closely related to concepts underlying numerous domain adaptation algorithms; and in our case; is motivated by the need to combine clinical and imaging based biomarkers from multiple sites and/or batches; where this problem is fairly common and an impediment in the conduct of analyses with much larger sample sizes. We develop a framework that addresses this problem using ideas from hypothesis testing on the transformed measurements; where in the distortions need to be estimated {\it in tandem} with the testing. We derive a simple algorithm and study its convergence and consistency properties in detail; and we also provide lower-bound strategies based on recent work in continuous optimization. On a dataset of individuals at risk for neurological disease; our results are competitive with alternative procedures that are twice as expensive and in some cases operationally infeasible to implement.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6209-hypothesis-testing-in-unsupervised-domain-adaptation-with-applications-in-alzheimers-disease/bibtex,Hao Zhou; Vamsi K.

In this paper; we consider an alternate model that treats individual opinions as spins in an Ising system at dynamic equilibrium. We formalize the \textit{Ising influence maximization} problem; which has a natural physical interpretation as maximizing the magnetization given a budget of external magnetic field. Under the mean-field (MF) approximation; we present a gradient ascent algorithm that uses the susceptibility to efficiently calculate local maxima of the magnetization; and we develop a number of sufficient conditions for when the MF magnetization is concave and our algorithm converges to a global optimum. We apply our algorithm on random and real-world networks; demonstrating; remarkably; that the MF optimal external fields (i.e.; the external fields which maximize the MF magnetization) exhibit a phase transition from focusing on high-degree individuals at high temperatures to focusing on low-degree individuals at low temperatures. We also establish a number of novel results about the structure of steady-states in the ferromagnetic MF Ising model on general graphs; which are of independent interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6119-maximizing-influence-in-an-ising-network-a-mean-field-optimal-solution/bibtex,Christopher Lynn; Daniel D.

Guarantees of correctness exist under the assumption that the data is sampled from a model. In this paper; we propose a framework; in which we obtain "correctness" guarantees without assuming the data comes from a model. The guarantees we obtain depend instead on the statistics of the data that can be checked. We also show that this framework ties in with the existing model-based framework; and that we can exploit results in model-based recovery; as well as strengthen the results existing in that area of research.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6140-graph-clustering-block-models-and-model-free-results/bibtex,Yali Wan; Marina Meila

In contrast to previous CNN-based approaches that optimize a surrogate patch similarity objective; we use deep metric learning to directly learn a feature space that preserves either geometric or semantic similarity. Our fully convolutional architecture; along with a novel correspondence contrastive loss allows faster training by effective reuse of computations; accurate gradient computation through the use of thousands of examples per image pair and faster testing with $O(n)$ feedforward passes for n keypoints; instead of $O(n^2)$ for typical patch similarity methods. We propose a convolutional spatial transformer to mimic patch normalization in traditional features like SIFT; which is shown to dramatically boost accuracy for semantic correspondences across intra-class shape variations. Extensive experiments on KITTI; PASCAL and CUB-2011 datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of our features over prior works that use either hand-constructed or learned features.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6487-universal-correspondence-network/bibtex,Christopher B.

For example; one may require a classifier to also make positive predictions at some specified rate for some subpopulation (fairness); or to achieve a specified empirical recall. Other real-world goals include reducing churn with respect to a previously deployed model; or stabilizing online training. In this paper we propose handling multiple goals on multiple datasets by training with dataset constraints; using the ramp penalty to accurately quantify costs; and present an efficient algorithm to approximately optimize the resulting non-convex constrained optimization problem. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world industry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6316-satisfying-real-world-goals-with-dataset-constraints/bibtex,Gabriel Goh; Andrew Cotter; Maya Gupta; Michael P.

The former often leads to tractable aggregation of elicited data; while the latter usually focuses on optimal elicitation and does not consider aggregation. In this paper; we develop a Bayesian model; wherein agents have differing quality of information; but also respond to incentives. Our model generalizes both categories and enables the joint exploration of optimal elicitation and aggregation. This model enables our exploration; both analytically and experimentally; of optimal aggregation of categorical data and optimal multiple-choice interface design.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6237-eliciting-categorical-data-for-optimal-aggregation/bibtex,Chien-Ju Ho; Rafael Frongillo; Yiling Chen
2016,Measuring the reliability of MCMC inference with bidirectional Monte Carlo,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6290-measuring-the-reliability-of-mcmc-inference-with-bidirectional-monte-carlo.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6290-measuring-the-reliability-of-mcmc-inference-with-bidirectional-monte-carlo,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is one of the main workhorses of probabilistic inference; but it is notoriously hard to measure the quality of approximate posterior samples. This challenge is particularly salient in black box inference methods; which can hide details and obscure inference failures. In this work; we extend the recently introduced bidirectional Monte Carlo technique to evaluate MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms. By running annealed importance sampling (AIS) chains both from prior to posterior and vice versa on simulated data; we upper bound in expectation the symmetrized KL divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of approximate samples. We integrate our method into two probabilistic programming languages; WebPPL and Stan; and validate it on several models and datasets. As an example of how our method be used to guide the design of inference algorithms; we apply it to study the effectiveness of different model representations in WebPPL and Stan.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6290-measuring-the-reliability-of-mcmc-inference-with-bidirectional-monte-carlo/bibtex,Roger B.

Most existing work either assumes that participants are perfectly rational; or attempts to directly model each participant's cognitive processes based on insights from cognitive psychology and experimental economics. In this work; we present an alternative; a deep learning approach that automatically performs cognitive modeling without relying on such expert knowledge.  We introduce a novel architecture that allows a single network to generalize across different input and output dimensions by using matrix units rather than scalar units; and show that its performance significantly outperforms that of the previous state of the art; which relies on expert-constructed features.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6509-deep-learning-for-predicting-human-strategic-behavior/bibtex,Jason S.

2016,Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation in Stochastic Combinatorial Partial Monitoring Games,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6198-phased-exploration-with-greedy-exploitation-in-stochastic-combinatorial-partial-monitoring-games.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6198-phased-exploration-with-greedy-exploitation-in-stochastic-combinatorial-partial-monitoring-games,Partial monitoring games are repeated games where the learner receives feedback that might be different from adversary's move or even the reward gained by the learner. Recently; a general model of combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) games was proposed \cite{lincombinatorial2014}; where the learner's action space can be exponentially large and adversary samples its moves from a bounded; continuous space; according to a fixed distribution. The paper gave a confidence bound based algorithm (GCB) that achieves $O(T^{2/3}\log T)$ distribution independent and $O(\log T)$ distribution dependent regret bounds. The implementation of their algorithm depends on two separate offline oracles and the distribution dependent regret additionally requires existence of a unique optimal action for the learner. Adopting their CPM model; our first contribution is a Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE) algorithmic framework for the problem. Different algorithms within the framework achieve $O(T^{2/3}\sqrt{\log T})$ distribution independent and $O(\log^2 T)$ distribution dependent regret respectively. Crucially; our framework needs only the simpler ``argmax'' oracle from GCB and the distribution dependent regret does not require existence of a unique optimal action. Our second contribution is another algorithm; PEGE2; which combines gap estimation with a PEGE algorithm; to achieve an $O(\log T)$ regret bound; matching the GCB guarantee but removing the dependence on size of  the learner's action space. However; like GCB; PEGE2 requires access to both offline oracles and the existence of a unique optimal action. Finally; we discuss how our algorithm can be efficiently applied to a CPM problem of practical interest: namely; online ranking with feedback at the top.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6198-phased-exploration-with-greedy-exploitation-in-stochastic-combinatorial-partial-monitoring-games/bibtex,Sougata Chaudhuri; Ambuj Tewari

State of the art approaches have been either geometric (nearest neighbor (NN) based) or kernel based (with bandwidth chosen to be data independent and vanishing sub linearly in the sample size). In this paper we combine both these approaches to design new estimators of entropy and mutual information that strongly outperform all state of the art methods. Our estimator uses bandwidth choice of fixed $k$-NN distances; such a choice is both data dependent and linearly vanishing in the sample size and necessitates a bias cancellation term that  is  universal and independent of the underlying distribution. As a byproduct; we obtain a unified way of obtaining both kernel and NN estimators.  The corresponding theoretical contribution relating the geometry of NN distances to asymptotic order statistics  is of independent mathematical interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6299-breaking-the-bandwidth-barrier-geometrical-adaptive-entropy-estimation/bibtex,Weihao Gao; Sewoong Oh; Pramod Viswanath
2016,A Bio-inspired Redundant Sensing Architecture,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6564-a-bio-inspired-redundant-sensing-architecture.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6564-a-bio-inspired-redundant-sensing-architecture,Sensing is the process of deriving signals from the environment that allows artificial systems to interact with the physical world. The Shannon theorem specifies the maximum rate at which information can be acquired. However; this upper bound is hard to achieve in many man-made systems. The biological visual systems; on the other hand; have highly efficient signal representation and processing mechanisms that allow precise sensing. In this work; we argue that redundancy is one of the critical characteristics for such superior performance. We show architectural advantages by utilizing redundant sensing; including correction of mismatch error and significant precision enhancement. For a proof-of-concept demonstration; we have designed a heuristic-based analog-to-digital converter - a zero-dimensional quantizer. Through Monte Carlo simulation with the error probabilistic distribution as a priori; the performance approaching the Shannon limit is feasible. In actual measurements without knowing the error distribution; we observe at least 2-bit extra precision. The results may also help explain biological processes including the dominance of binocular vision; the functional roles of the fixational eye movements; and the structural mechanisms allowing hyperacuity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6564-a-bio-inspired-redundant-sensing-architecture/bibtex,Anh Tuan Nguyen; Jian Xu; Zhi Yang

While much work has been done establishing both robust estimators and effective data injection attacks when the attacker is omniscient; the ability of an attacker to provably harm learning while having access to little information is largely unstudied. We study the potential of a ?blind attacker? to provably limit a learner?s performance by data injection attack without observing the learner?s training set or any parameter of the distribution from which it is drawn. We provide examples of simple yet effective attacks in two settings: firstly; where an ?informed learner? knows the strategy chosen by the attacker; and secondly; where a ?blind learner? knows only the proportion of malicious data and some family to which the malicious distribution chosen by the attacker belongs. For each attack; we analyze minimax rates of convergence and establish lower bounds on the learner?s minimax risk; exhibiting limits on a learner?s ability to learn under data injection attack even when the attacker is ?blind?.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6482-blind-attacks-on-machine-learners/bibtex,Alex Beatson; Zhaoran Wang; Han Liu

We first construct a RF and then prune it to optimize expected feature cost & accuracy. We pose pruning RFs as a novel 0-1 integer program with linear constraints that encourages feature re-use. We establish total unimodularity of the constraint set to prove that the corresponding LP relaxation solves the original integer program. We then exploit connections to combinatorial optimization and develop an efficient primal-dual algorithm; scalable to large datasets. In contrast to our bottom-up approach; which benefits from good RF initialization; conventional methods are top-down acquiring features based on their utility value and is generally intractable; requiring heuristics.  Empirically; our pruning algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art resource-constrained algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6250-pruning-random-forests-for-prediction-on-a-budget/bibtex,Feng Nan; Joseph Wang; Venkatesh Saligrama

These problems; known as contextual semibandits; arise in crowdsourcing; recommendation; and many other domains. This paper reduces contextual semibandits to supervised learning; allowing us to leverage powerful supervised learning methods in this partial-feedback setting. Our first reduction applies when the mapping from feedback to reward is known and leads to a computationally efficient algorithm with near-optimal regret. We show that this algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on real-world learning-to-rank datasets; demonstrating the advantage of oracle-based algorithms. Our second reduction applies to the previously unstudied setting when the linear mapping from feedback to reward is unknown. Our regret guarantees are superior to prior techniques that ignore the feedback.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6513-contextual-semibandits-via-supervised-learning-oracles/bibtex,Akshay Krishnamurthy; Alekh Agarwal; Miro Dudik
2016,Hierarchical Clustering via Spreading Metrics,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6325-hierarchical-clustering-via-spreading-metrics.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6325-hierarchical-clustering-via-spreading-metrics,We study the cost function for  hierarchical clusterings introduced by [Dasgupta; 2015]  where hierarchies are treated as first-class objects rather than deriving their cost from projections into flat clusters. It was also shown in [Dasgupta; 2015] that a top-down algorithm  returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most \(O\left(\alpha_n \log n\right)\) times the cost of the optimal hierarchical clustering; where \(\alpha_n\) is the approximation ratio of the Sparsest Cut subroutine used. Thus using the best known approximation algorithm for Sparsest Cut due to Arora-Rao-Vazirani;  the top down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most  \(O\left(\log^{3/2} n\right)\) times the cost of the optimal solution. We improve this by giving an \(O(\log{n})\)-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our main technical ingredients are a combinatorial characterization of ultrametrics induced by this cost function; deriving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for this family of ultrametrics; and showing how to iteratively round an LP relaxation of this formulation by  using the idea of \emph{sphere growing} which has been extensively used in the context of graph  partitioning. We also prove that our algorithm returns an \(O(\log{n})\)-approximate  hierarchical clustering for a generalization of this cost function also studied in [Dasgupta; 2015]. Experiments show that the hierarchies found by using the ILP formulation as well  as our rounding algorithm often have better projections into flat clusters than the standard linkage based algorithms. We conclude with an inapproximability result for this problem; namely that no polynomial sized LP or SDP can be used to obtain a constant factor approximation for this problem.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6325-hierarchical-clustering-via-spreading-metrics/bibtex,Aurko Roy; Sebastian Pokutta

Our approach is based on a recently proposed framework for optimal structure learning based on non-decomposable scores; which is general enough to accommodate ancestral constraints. The proposed framework exploits oracles for learning structures using decomposable scores; which cannot accommodate ancestral constraints since they are non-decomposable. We show how to empower these oracles by passing them decomposable constraints that they can handle; which are inferred from ancestral constraints that they cannot handle. Empirically; we demonstrate that our approach can be orders-of-magnitude more efficient than alternative frameworks; such as those based on integer linear programming.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6386-learning-bayesian-networks-with-ancestral-constraints/bibtex,Eunice Yuh-Jie Chen; Yujia Shen; Arthur Choi; Adnan Darwiche

Graphons are a  far richer class of graph models than stochastic blockmodels; the primary setting for recent progress in the statistical theory of graph clustering.

The review network performs a number of review steps with attention mechanism on the encoder hidden states; and outputs a thought vector after each review step; the thought vectors are used as the input of the attention mechanism in the decoder.

The Deep Generative Deconvolutional Network (DGDN) is used as a decoder of the latent image features; and a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as an image encoder; the CNN is used to approximate a distribution for the latent DGDN features/code. The latent code is also linked to generative models for labels (Bayesian support vector machine) or captions (recurrent neural network). When predicting a label/caption for a new image at test; averaging is performed across the distribution of latent codes; this is computationally efficient as a consequence of the learned CNN-based encoder. Since the framework is capable of modeling the image in the presence/absence of associated labels/captions; a new semi-supervised setting is manifested for CNN learning with images; the framework even allows unsupervised CNN learning; based on images alone.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6528-variational-autoencoder-for-deep-learning-of-images-labels-and-captions/bibtex,Yunchen Pu; Zhe Gan; Ricardo Henao; Xin Yuan; Chunyuan Li; Andrew Stevens; Lawrence Carin

In this paper; we develop and analyze a new model-based approach to compute a safe policy when we have access to an inaccurate dynamics model of the system with known accuracy guarantees. Our proposed robust method uses this (inaccurate) model to directly minimize the (negative) regret w.r.t. the baseline policy. Contrary to the existing approaches; minimizing the regret allows one to improve the baseline policy in states with accurate dynamics and seamlessly fall back to the baseline policy; otherwise. We show that our formulation is NP-hard and propose an approximate algorithm. Our empirical results on several domains show that even this relatively simple approximate algorithm can significantly outperform standard approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6294-safe-policy-improvement-by-minimizing-robust-baseline-regret/bibtex,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh; Marek Petrik; Yinlam Chow
2016,Finding significant combinations of features in the presence of categorical covariates,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6345-finding-significant-combinations-of-features-in-the-presence-of-categorical-covariates.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6345-finding-significant-combinations-of-features-in-the-presence-of-categorical-covariates,In high-dimensional settings; where the number of features p is typically much larger than the number of samples n; methods which can systematically examine arbitrary combinations of features; a huge 2^p-dimensional space; have recently begun to be explored. However; none of the current methods is able to assess the association between feature combinations and a target variable while conditioning on a categorical covariate; in order to correct for potential confounding effects.  We propose the Fast Automatic Conditional Search (FACS) algorithm; a significant discriminative itemset mining method which conditions on categorical covariates and only scales as O(k log k); where k is the number of states of the categorical covariate. Based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test; FACS demonstrates superior speed and statistical power on simulated and real-world datasets compared to the state of the art; opening the door to numerous applications in biomedicine.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6345-finding-significant-combinations-of-features-in-the-presence-of-categorical-covariates/bibtex,Laetitia Papaxanthos; Felipe Llinares-Lopez; Dean Bodenham; Karsten Borgwardt

This allows us to devise a computationally efficient algorithm for bandit convex optimization with new state-of-the-art guarantees for both Lipschitz loss functions and loss functions with Lipschitz gradients. This is the first algorithm admitting both a polynomial time complexity and a regret that is polynomial in the dimension of the action space that improves upon the original regret bound for Lipschitz loss functions; achieving a regret of $\widetilde O(T^{11/16}d^{3/8})$. Our algorithm further improves upon the best existing polynomial-in-dimension bound (both computationally and in terms of regret) for loss functions with Lipschitz gradients; achieving a regret of $\widetilde O(T^{8/13} d^{5/3})$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6429-optimistic-bandit-convex-optimization/bibtex,Scott Yang; Mehryar Mohri

We introduce the notion of a computation skeleton; an acyclic graph that succinctly describes both a family of neural networks and a kernel space. Random neural networks are generated from a skeleton through node replication followed by sampling from a normal distribution to assign weights. The kernel space consists of functions that arise by compositions; averaging; and non-linear transformations governed by the skeleton's graph topology and activation functions. We prove that random networks induce representations which approximate the kernel space. In particular; it follows that random weight initialization often yields a favorable starting point for optimization despite the worst-case intractability of training neural networks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6427-toward-deeper-understanding-of-neural-networks-the-power-of-initialization-and-a-dual-view-on-expressivity/bibtex,Amit Daniely; Roy Frostig; Yoram Singer

2016,Examples are not enough; learn to criticize! Criticism for Interpretability,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6300-examples-are-not-enough-learn-to-criticize-criticism-for-interpretability.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6300-examples-are-not-enough-learn-to-criticize-criticism-for-interpretability,Example-based explanations are widely used in the effort to improve the interpretability of highly complex distributions. However; prototypes alone are rarely sufficient to represent the gist of the complexity. In order for users to construct better mental models and understand complex data distributions; we also need {\em criticism} to explain what are \textit{not} captured by prototypes.  Motivated by the Bayesian model criticism framework; we develop \texttt{MMD-critic} which efficiently learns prototypes and criticism; designed to aid human interpretability. A human subject pilot study shows that the \texttt{MMD-critic} selects prototypes and criticism that are useful to facilitate human understanding and reasoning. We also evaluate the prototypes selected by \texttt{MMD-critic} via a nearest prototype classifier; showing competitive performance compared to baselines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6300-examples-are-not-enough-learn-to-criticize-criticism-for-interpretability/bibtex,Been Kim; Rajiv Khanna; Oluwasanmi O.

Our methods apply to distributionally robust optimization problems proposed by Ben-Tal et al.; which put more weight on observations inducing high loss via a worst-case approach over a non-parametric uncertainty set on the underlying data distribution. Our algorithm solves the resulting minimax problems with nearly the same computational cost of stochastic gradient descent through the use of several carefully designed data structures. For a sample of size n; the per-iteration cost of our method scales as O(log n); which allows us to give optimality certificates that distributionally robust optimization provides at little extra cost compared to empirical risk minimization and stochastic gradient methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6040-stochastic-gradient-methods-for-distributionally-robust-optimization-with-f-divergences/bibtex,Hongseok Namkoong; John C.

Our method approximately solves the following   $n$-dimensional quadratic minimization problem in constant time;   which is independent of $n$:   $z^*=\min_{\bv \in \bbR^n}\bracket{\bv}{A \bv} +   n\bracket{\bv}{\diag(\bd)\bv} + n\bracket{\bb}{\bv}$;   where $A \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ is a matrix and $\bd;\bb \in \bbR^n$   are vectors. Our theoretical analysis specifies the number of   samples $k(\delta; \epsilon)$ such that the approximated solution   $z$ satisfies $|z - z^*| = O(\epsilon n^2)$ with probability   $1-\delta$.

This paper introduces stochastic recurrent neural networks which glue a deterministic recurrent neural network and a state space model together to form a stochastic and sequential neural generative model. The clear separation of deterministic and stochastic layers allows a structured variational inference network to track the factorization of the model?s posterior distribution. By retaining both the nonlinear recursive structure of a recurrent neural network and averaging over the uncertainty in a latent path; like a state space model; we improve the state of the art results on the Blizzard and TIMIT speech modeling data sets by a large margin; while achieving comparable performances to competing methods on polyphonic music modeling.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6039-sequential-neural-models-with-stochastic-layers/bibtex,Marco Fraccaro; S?ren Kaae S?nderby; Ulrich Paquet; Ole Winther

Specifically; we show that the sleeping versions of these problems are at least as hard as PAC learning DNF expressions; a long standing open problem. We show hardness for the sleeping versions of Online Shortest Paths; Online Minimum Spanning Tree; Online k-Subsets; Online k-Truncated Permutations; Online Minimum Cut; and Online Bipartite Matching.

The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: Our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data; and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%.

While very deep and wide networks have proven effective in general; they come at a high memory and computation cost; thus making them impractical for constrained platforms. These networks; however; are known to have many redundant parameters; and could thus; in principle; be replaced by more compact architectures. In this paper; we introduce an approach to automatically determining the number of neurons in each layer of a deep network during learning. To this end; we propose to make use of a group sparsity regularizer on the parameters of the network; where each group is defined to act on a single neuron. Starting from an overcomplete network; we show that our approach can reduce the number of parameters by up to 80\% while retaining or even improving the network accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6372-learning-the-number-of-neurons-in-deep-networks/bibtex,Jose M.

Typically; the communication protocol between agents is manually specified and not altered during training. In this paper we explore a simple neural model; called CommNet; that uses continuous communication for fully cooperative tasks. The model consists of multiple agents and the communication between them is learned alongside their policy. We apply this model to a diverse set of tasks; demonstrating the ability of the agents to learn to communicate amongst themselves; yielding improved performance over non-communicative agents and baselines. In some cases; it is possible to interpret the language devised by the agents; revealing simple but effective strategies for solving the task at hand.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6398-learning-multiagent-communication-with-backpropagation/bibtex,Sainbayar Sukhbaatar; arthur szlam; Rob Fergus
2016,On the Recursive Teaching Dimension of VC Classes,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6412-on-the-recursive-teaching-dimension-of-vc-classes.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6412-on-the-recursive-teaching-dimension-of-vc-classes,The recursive teaching dimension (RTD) of a concept class $C \subseteq \{0; 1\}^n$; introduced by Zilles et al. [ZLHZ11]; is a complexity parameter measured by the worst-case number of labeled examples needed to learn any target concept of $C$ in the recursive teaching model. In this paper; we study the quantitative relation between RTD and the well-known learning complexity measure VC dimension (VCD); and improve the best known upper and (worst-case) lower bounds on the recursive teaching dimension with respect to the VC dimension.  Given a concept class $C \subseteq \{0; 1\}^n$ with $VCD(C) = d$; we first show that $RTD(C)$ is at most $d 2^{d+1}$. This is the first upper bound for $RTD(C)$ that depends only on $VCD(C)$; independent of the size of the concept class $|C|$ and its~domain size $n$. Before our work; the best known upper bound for $RTD(C)$ is $O(d 2^d \log \log |C|)$; obtained by Moran et al. [MSWY15]. We remove the $\log \log |C|$ factor.  We also improve the lower bound on the worst-case ratio of $RTD(C)$ to $VCD(C)$. We present a family of classes $\{ C_k \}_{k \ge 1}$ with $VCD(C_k) = 3k$ and $RTD(C_k)=5k$; which implies that the ratio of $RTD(C)$ to $VCD(C)$ in the worst case can be as large as $5/3$. Before our work; the largest ratio known was $3/2$ as obtained by Kuhlmann [Kuh99]. Since then; no finite concept class $C$ has been known to satisfy $RTD(C) > (3/2) VCD(C)$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6412-on-the-recursive-teaching-dimension-of-vc-classes/bibtex,Xi Chen; Xi Chen; Yu Cheng; Bo Tang
2016,Mixed Linear Regression with Multiple Components,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6240-mixed-linear-regression-with-multiple-components.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6240-mixed-linear-regression-with-multiple-components,In this paper; we study the mixed linear regression (MLR) problem; where the goal is to recover multiple underlying linear models from their unlabeled linear measurements. We propose a non-convex objective function which we show is {\em locally strongly convex} in the neighborhood of the ground truth. We use a tensor method for initialization so that the initial models are in the local strong convexity region. We then employ general convex optimization algorithms to minimize the objective function. To the best of our knowledge; our approach provides first exact recovery guarantees for the MLR problem with $K \geq 2$ components. Moreover;  our method has near-optimal computational complexity $\tilde O (Nd)$ as well as near-optimal sample complexity $\tilde O (d)$ for {\em constant} $K$. Furthermore; we show that our non-convex formulation can be extended to solving the {\em subspace clustering} problem as well. In particular; when initialized within a small constant distance to the true subspaces; our method converges to the global optima (and recovers true subspaces) in time {\em linear} in the number of points. Furthermore; our empirical results indicate that even with random initialization; our approach converges to the global optima in linear time; providing speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6240-mixed-linear-regression-with-multiple-components/bibtex,Kai Zhong; Prateek Jain; Inderjit S.

InfoGAN is a generative adversarial network that also maximizes the mutual information between a small subset of the latent variables and the observation. We derive a lower bound to the mutual information objective that can be optimized efficiently; and show that our training procedure can be interpreted as a variation of the Wake-Sleep algorithm. Specifically; InfoGAN successfully disentangles writing styles from digit shapes on the MNIST dataset; pose from lighting of 3D rendered images; and background digits from the central digit on the SVHN dataset. It also discovers visual concepts that include hair styles; presence/absence of eyeglasses; and emotions on the CelebA face dataset. Experiments show that InfoGAN learns interpretable representations that are competitive with representations learned by existing fully supervised methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6399-infogan-interpretable-representation-learning-by-information-maximizing-generative-adversarial-nets/bibtex,Xi Chen; Yan Duan; Rein Houthooft; John Schulman; Ilya Sutskever; Pieter Abbeel
2016,Blind Regression: Nonparametric Regression for Latent Variable Models via Collaborative Filtering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6108-blind-regression-nonparametric-regression-for-latent-variable-models-via-collaborative-filtering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6108-blind-regression-nonparametric-regression-for-latent-variable-models-via-collaborative-filtering,We introduce the framework of {\em blind regression} motivated by {\em matrix completion} for recommendation systems: given $m$ users; $n$ movies; and a subset of user-movie ratings; the goal is to predict the unobserved user-movie ratings given the data; i.e.; to complete the partially observed matrix. Following the framework of non-parametric statistics; we posit that user $u$ and movie $i$ have features $x_1(u)$ and $x_2(i)$ respectively; and their corresponding rating $y(u;i)$ is a noisy measurement of $f(x_1(u); x_2(i))$ for some unknown function $f$. In contrast with classical regression; the features $x = (x_1(u); x_2(i))$ are not observed; making it challenging to apply standard regression methods to  predict the unobserved ratings.  Inspired by the classical Taylor's expansion for differentiable functions; we provide a prediction algorithm that is consistent for all Lipschitz functions. In fact; the analysis through our framework naturally leads to a variant of collaborative filtering; shedding insight into the widespread success of collaborative filtering in practice. Assuming each entry is sampled independently with probability at least $\max(m^{-1+\delta};n^{-1/2+\delta})$ with $\delta > 0$; we prove that the expected fraction of our estimates with error greater than $\epsilon$ is less than $\gamma^2 / \epsilon^2$ plus a polynomially decaying term; where $\gamma^2$ is the variance of the additive entry-wise noise term.  Experiments with the MovieLens and Netflix datasets suggest that our algorithm provides principled improvements over basic collaborative filtering and is competitive with matrix factorization methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6108-blind-regression-nonparametric-regression-for-latent-variable-models-via-collaborative-filtering/bibtex,Dogyoon Song; Christina E.

We consider different noise and abstention conditions of the labeler. We propose an algorithm which utilizes abstention responses; and analyze its statistical consistency and query complexity under fairly natural assumptions on the noise and abstention rate of the labeler. This algorithm is adaptive in a sense that it can automatically request less queries with a more informed or less noisy labeler. We couple our algorithm with lower bounds to show that under some technical conditions; it achieves nearly optimal query complexity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6162-active-learning-from-imperfect-labelers/bibtex,Songbai Yan; Kamalika Chaudhuri; Tara Javidi

However; distributed computing is often bottle necked by a small fraction of slow processors called "stragglers" that reduce the speed of computation because the fusion node has to wait for all processors to complete their processing. To combat the effect of stragglers; recent literature proposes introducing redundancy in computations across processors; e.g.; using repetition-based strategies or erasure codes. The fusion node can exploit this redundancy by completing the computation using outputs from only a subset of the processors; ignoring the stragglers. In this paper; we propose a novel technique - that we call "Short-Dot" - to introduce redundant computations in a coding theory inspired fashion; for computing linear transforms of long vectors. Instead of computing long dot products as required in the original linear transform; we construct a larger number of redundant and short dot products that can be computed more efficiently at individual processors. Further; only a subset of these short dot products are required at the fusion node to finish the computation successfully. We demonstrate through probabilistic analysis as well as experiments on computing clusters that Short-Dot offers significant speed-up compared to existing techniques. We also derive trade-offs between the length of the dot-products and the resilience to stragglers (number of processors required to finish); for any such strategy and compare it to that achieved by our strategy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6329-short-dot-computing-large-linear-transforms-distributedly-using-coded-short-dot-products/bibtex,Sanghamitra Dutta; Viveck Cadambe; Pulkit Grover

Representational similarity analysis revealed the existence of a representational gradient across the superior temporal gyrus (STG).

VINs can learn to plan; and are suitable for predicting outcomes that involve planning-based reasoning; such as policies for reinforcement learning. Key to our approach is a novel differentiable approximation of the value-iteration algorithm; which can be represented as a convolutional neural network; and trained end-to-end using standard backpropagation. We evaluate VIN based policies on discrete and continuous path-planning domains; and on a natural-language based search task. We show that by learning an explicit planning computation; VIN policies generalize better to new; unseen domains.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6046-value-iteration-networks/bibtex,Aviv Tamar; YI WU; Garrett Thomas; Sergey Levine; Pieter Abbeel
2016,Learning Transferrable Representations for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6360-learning-transferrable-representations-for-unsupervised-domain-adaptation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6360-learning-transferrable-representations-for-unsupervised-domain-adaptation,Supervised learning with large scale labelled datasets and deep layered models has caused a paradigm shift in diverse areas in learning and recognition. However; this approach still suffers from generalization issues under the presence of a domain shift between the training and the test data distribution. Since unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms directly address this domain shift problem between a labelled source dataset and an unlabelled target dataset; recent papers have shown promising results by fine-tuning the networks with domain adaptation loss functions which try to align the mismatch between the training and testing data distributions.  Nevertheless; these recent deep learning based domain adaptation approaches still suffer from issues such as high sensitivity to the gradient reversal hyperparameters and overfitting during the fine-tuning stage. In this paper; we propose a unified deep learning framework where the representation; cross domain transformation; and target label inference are all jointly optimized in an end-to-end fashion for unsupervised domain adaptation. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both object recognition and digit classification experiments by a large margin. We will make our learned models as well as the source code available immediately upon acceptance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6360-learning-transferrable-representations-for-unsupervised-domain-adaptation/bibtex,Ozan Sener; Hyun Oh Song; Ashutosh Saxena; Silvio Savarese

In the traditional economic models; it is assumed that the bidders' valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution and that the auction designer has perfect knowledge of this distribution. Despite this strong and oftentimes unrealistic assumption; it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing combinatorial auction remains unknown. In recent years; automated mechanism design has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to designing high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The most scalable automated mechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders' valuation distribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction class. In this work; we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in automated mechanism design. In particular; we provide tight sample complexity bounds on the number of samples needed to guarantee that the empirical revenue of the designed mechanism on the samples is close to its expected revenue on the underlying; unknown distribution over bidder valuations; for each of the auction classes in the hierarchy. In addition to helping set automated mechanism design on firm foundations; our results also push the boundaries of learning theory. In particular; the hypothesis functions used in our contexts are defined through multi stage combinatorial optimization procedures; rather than simple decision boundaries; as are common in machine learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6351-sample-complexity-of-automated-mechanism-design/bibtex,Maria-Florina F.

In these environments; agents must learn communication protocols in order to share information that is needed to solve the tasks. By embracing deep neural networks; we are able to demonstrate end-to-end learning of protocols in complex environments inspired by communication riddles and multi-agent computer vision problems with partial observability. We propose two approaches for learning in these domains: Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL) and Differentiable Inter-Agent Learning (DIAL). The former uses deep Q-learning; while the latter exploits the fact that; during learning; agents can backpropagate error derivatives through (noisy) communication channels. Hence; this approach uses centralised learning but decentralised execution. Our experiments introduce new environments for studying the learning of communication protocols and present a set of engineering innovations that are essential for success in these domains.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6042-learning-to-communicate-with-deep-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Jakob Foerster; Ioannis Alexandros Assael; Nando de Freitas; Shimon Whiteson
2016,Learning Structured Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6504-learning-structured-sparsity-in-deep-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6504-learning-structured-sparsity-in-deep-neural-networks,High demand for computation resources severely hinders deployment of large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in resource constrained devices. In this work; we propose a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method to regularize the structures (i.e.; filters; channels; filter shapes; and layer depth) of DNNs. SSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently accelerate the DNN?s evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on average 5.1X and 3.1X speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet against CPU and GPU; respectively; with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN structure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for CIFAR-10; regularization on layer depth reduces a 20-layer Deep Residual Network (ResNet) to 18 layers while improves the accuracy from 91.25% to 92.60%; which is still higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers. For AlexNet; SSL reduces the error by ~1%.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6504-learning-structured-sparsity-in-deep-neural-networks/bibtex,Wei Wen; Chunpeng Wu; Yandan Wang; Yiran Chen; Hai Li

In these contexts; it is beneficial to provide these oracle mechanisms with multiple highly likely hypotheses rather than a single prediction. In this work; we pose the task of producing multiple outputs as a learning problem over an ensemble of deep networks -- introducing a novel stochastic gradient descent based approach to minimize the loss with respect to an oracle. Our method is simple to implement; agnostic to both architecture and loss function; and parameter-free. Our approach achieves lower oracle error compared to existing methods on a wide range of tasks and deep architectures. We also show qualitatively that solutions produced from our approach often provide interpretable representations of task ambiguity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6270-stochastic-multiple-choice-learning-for-training-diverse-deep-ensembles/bibtex,Stefan Lee; Senthil Purushwalkam Shiva Prakash; Michael Cogswell; Viresh Ranjan; David Crandall; Dhruv Batra
2016,Learning Influence Functions from Incomplete Observations,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6181-learning-influence-functions-from-incomplete-observations.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6181-learning-influence-functions-from-incomplete-observations,We study the problem of learning influence functions under incomplete observations of node activations. Incomplete observations are a major concern as most (online and real-world) social networks are not fully observable. We establish both proper and improper PAC learnability of influence functions under randomly missing observations. Proper PAC learnability under the Discrete-Time Linear Threshold (DLT) and Discrete-Time Independent Cascade (DIC) models is established by reducing incomplete observations to complete observations in a modified graph. Our improper PAC learnability result applies for the DLT and DIC models as well as the Continuous-Time Independent Cascade (CIC) model.  It is based on a parametrization in terms of reachability features; and also gives rise to an efficient and practical heuristic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of our method to compensate even for a fairly large fraction of missing observations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6181-learning-influence-functions-from-incomplete-observations/bibtex,Xinran He; Ke Xu; David Kempe; Yan Liu
2016,Tensor Switching Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6516-tensor-switching-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6516-tensor-switching-networks,We present a novel neural network algorithm; the Tensor Switching (TS) network; which generalizes the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity to tensor-valued hidden units. The TS network copies its entire input vector to different locations in an expanded representation; with the location determined by its hidden unit activity. In this way; even a simple linear readout from the TS representation can implement a highly expressive deep-network-like function. The TS network hence avoids the vanishing gradient problem by construction; at the cost of larger representation size. We develop several methods to train the TS network; including equivalent kernels for infinitely wide and deep TS networks; a one-pass linear learning algorithm; and two backpropagation-inspired representation learning algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that the TS network is indeed more expressive and consistently learns faster than standard ReLU networks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6516-tensor-switching-networks/bibtex,Chuan-Yung Tsai; Andrew M.

2016,Coordinate-wise Power Method,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6103-coordinate-wise-power-method.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6103-coordinate-wise-power-method,In this paper; we propose a coordinate-wise version of the power method from an optimization viewpoint. The vanilla power method simultaneously updates all the coordinates of the iterate; which is essential for its convergence analysis. However; different coordinates converge to the optimal value at different speeds. Our proposed algorithm; which we call coordinate-wise power method; is able to select and update the most important k coordinates in O(kn) time at each iteration; where n is the dimension of the matrix and k <= n is the size of the active set. Inspired by the ''greedy'' nature of our method; we further propose a greedy coordinate descent algorithm applied on a non-convex objective function specialized for symmetric matrices. We provide convergence analyses for both methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that our methods achieve up to 20 times speedup over the basic power method. Meanwhile; due to their coordinate-wise nature; our methods are very suitable for the important case when data cannot fit into memory. Finally; we introduce how the coordinate-wise mechanism could be applied to other iterative methods that are used in machine learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6103-coordinate-wise-power-method/bibtex,Qi Lei; Kai Zhong; Inderjit S.

2016,Inference by Reparameterization in Neural Population Codes,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6476-inference-by-reparameterization-in-neural-population-codes.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6476-inference-by-reparameterization-in-neural-population-codes,Behavioral experiments on humans and animals suggest that the brain performs probabilistic inference to interpret its environment. Here we present a new general-purpose; biologically-plausible neural implementation of approximate inference. The neural network represents uncertainty using Probabilistic Population Codes (PPCs); which are distributed neural representations that naturally encode probability distributions; and support marginalization and evidence integration in a biologically-plausible manner. By connecting multiple PPCs together as a probabilistic graphical model; we represent multivariate probability distributions. Approximate inference in graphical models can be accomplished by message-passing algorithms that disseminate local information throughout the graph. An attractive and often accurate example of such an algorithm is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP); which uses local marginalization and evidence integration operations to perform approximate inference efficiently even for complex models. Unfortunately; a subtle feature of LBP renders it neurally implausible. However; LBP can be elegantly reformulated as a sequence of Tree-based Reparameterizations (TRP) of the graphical model. We re-express the TRP updates as a nonlinear dynamical system with both fast and slow timescales; and show that this produces a neurally plausible solution. By combining all of these ideas; we show that a network of PPCs can represent multivariate probability distributions and implement the TRP updates to perform probabilistic inference. Simulations with Gaussian graphical models demonstrate that the neural network inference quality is comparable to the direct evaluation of LBP and robust to noise; and thus provides a promising mechanism for general probabilistic inference in the population codes of the brain.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6476-inference-by-reparameterization-in-neural-population-codes/bibtex,Rajkumar Vasudeva Raju; Xaq Pitkow

In this paper we construct a non-parametric learning algorithm to estimate the clinical state of a patient. The algorithm addresses several known challenges with clinical state estimation such as eliminating bias introduced by therapeutic intervention censoring; increasing the timeliness of state estimation while ensuring a sufficient accuracy; and the ability to detect anomalous clinical states. These benefits are obtained by combining the tools of non-parametric Bayesian inference; permutation testing; and generalizations of the empirical Bernstein inequality. The algorithm is validated using real-world data from a cancer ward in a large academic hospital.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6454-a-non-parametric-learning-method-for-confidently-estimating-patients-clinical-state-and-dynamics/bibtex,William Hoiles; Mihaela Van Der Schaar

Unfortunately; extracting the spike train of each neuron from raw fluorescence calcium imaging data is a nontrivial problem. We present a fast online active set method to solve this sparse nonnegative deconvolution problem. Importantly; the algorithm progresses through each time series sequentially from beginning to end; thus enabling real-time online spike inference during the imaging session. Our algorithm is a generalization of the pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) for isotonic regression and inherits its linear-time computational complexity. We gain remarkable increases in processing speed:  more than one order of magnitude compared to currently employed state of the art convex solvers relying on interior point methods. Our method can exploit warm starts; therefore optimizing model hyperparameters only requires a handful of passes through the data. The algorithm enables real-time simultaneous deconvolution of $O(10^5)$ traces of whole-brain zebrafish imaging data on a laptop.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6505-fast-active-set-methods-for-online-spike-inference-from-calcium-imaging/bibtex,Johannes Friedrich; Liam Paninski
2016,Bayesian latent structure discovery from multi-neuron recordings,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6185-bayesian-latent-structure-discovery-from-multi-neuron-recordings.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6185-bayesian-latent-structure-discovery-from-multi-neuron-recordings,Neural circuits contain heterogeneous groups of neurons that differ in type; location; connectivity; and basic response properties. However; traditional methods for dimensionality reduction and clustering are ill-suited to recovering the structure underlying the organization of neural circuits. In particular; they do not take advantage of the rich temporal dependencies in multi-neuron recordings and fail to account for the noise in neural spike trains. Here we describe new tools for inferring latent structure from simultaneously recorded spike train data using a hierarchical extension of a multi-neuron point process model commonly known as the generalized linear model (GLM). Our approach combines the GLM with flexible graph-theoretic priors governing the relationship between latent features and neural connectivity patterns. Fully Bayesian inference via P?lya-gamma augmentation of the resulting model allows us to classify neurons and infer latent dimensions of circuit organization from correlated spike trains.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with applications to synthetic data and multi-neuron recordings in primate retina; revealing latent patterns of neural types and locations from spike trains alone.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6185-bayesian-latent-structure-discovery-from-multi-neuron-recordings/bibtex,Scott Linderman; Ryan P.

2016,Stochastic Gradient Richardson-Romberg Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6514-stochastic-gradient-richardson-romberg-markov-chain-monte-carlo.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6514-stochastic-gradient-richardson-romberg-markov-chain-monte-carlo,Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) algorithms have become increasingly popular for Bayesian inference in large-scale applications. Even though these methods have proved useful in several scenarios; their performance is often limited by their bias. In this study; we propose a novel sampling algorithm that aims to reduce the bias of SG-MCMC while keeping the variance at a reasonable level. Our approach is based on a numerical sequence acceleration method; namely the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation; which simply boils down   to running almost the same SG-MCMC algorithm twice in parallel with different step sizes. We illustrate our framework on the popular Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm and propose a novel SG-MCMC algorithm referred to as Stochastic Gradient Richardson-Romberg Langevin Dynamics (SGRRLD). We provide formal theoretical analysis and show that SGRRLD is asymptotically consistent; satisfies a central limit theorem; and its non-asymptotic bias and the mean squared-error can be bounded. Our results show that SGRRLD attains higher rates of convergence than SGLD in both finite-time and asymptotically; and it achieves the theoretical   accuracy of the methods that are based on higher-order integrators. We support our findings using both synthetic and real data experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6514-stochastic-gradient-richardson-romberg-markov-chain-monte-carlo/bibtex,Alain Durmus; Umut Simsekli; Eric Moulines; Roland Badeau; Ga?l RICHARD

This paper introduces composable generative population models (CGPMs); a computational abstraction that extends directed graphical models and can be used to describe and compose a broad class of probabilistic data analysis techniques. Examples include discriminative machine learning; hierarchical Bayesian models; multivariate kernel methods; clustering algorithms; and arbitrary probabilistic programs. We demonstrate the integration of CGPMs into BayesDB; a probabilistic programming platform that can express data analysis tasks using a modeling definition language and structured query language. The practical value is illustrated in two ways. First; the paper describes an analysis on a database of Earth satellites; which identifies records that probably violate Kepler?s Third Law by composing causal probabilistic programs with non-parametric Bayes in 50 lines of probabilistic code. Second; it reports the lines of code and accuracy of CGPMs compared with baseline solutions from standard machine learning libraries.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6060-a-probabilistic-programming-approach-to-probabilistic-data-analysis/bibtex,Feras Saad; Vikash K.

Through the introduction of a diffusion-convolution operation; we show how diffusion-based representations can be learned from graph-structured data and used as an effective basis for node classification. DCNNs have several attractive qualities; including a latent representation for graphical data that is invariant under isomorphism; as well as polynomial-time prediction and learning that can be represented as tensor operations and efficiently implemented on a GPU.  Through several experiments with real structured datasets; we demonstrate that DCNNs are able to  outperform probabilistic relational models and kernel-on-graph methods at relational node classification tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6212-diffusion-convolutional-neural-networks/bibtex,James Atwood; Don Towsley

A principled way to do this is the information bottleneck (IB) method; where one seeks a code that maximises information about  a relevance variable; Y; while constraining the information encoded about the original data; X. Unfortunately however; the IB method is computationally demanding when data are high-dimensional and/or non-gaussian. Here we propose an approximate variational scheme for maximising a lower bound on the IB objective; analogous to variational EM. Using this method; we derive an IB algorithm to recover features that are both relevant and sparse. Finally; we demonstrate how kernelised versions of the algorithm can be used to address a broad range of problems with non-linear relation between X and Y.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6101-relevant-sparse-codes-with-variational-information-bottleneck/bibtex,Matthew Chalk; Olivier Marre; Gasper Tkacik

We call this technique Orthogonal Random Features (ORF); and provide theoretical and empirical justification for its effectiveness. Motivated by the discovery; we further propose Structured Orthogonal Random Features (SORF); which uses a class of structured discrete orthogonal matrices to speed up the computation. The method reduces the time cost from $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$; where $d$ is the data dimensionality; with almost no compromise in kernel approximation quality compared to ORF. Experiments on several datasets verify the effectiveness of ORF and SORF over the existing methods. We also provide discussions on using the same type of discrete orthogonal structure for a broader range of kernels and applications.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6246-orthogonal-random-features/bibtex,Felix X.

Our approach; combinatorial energy learning for image segmentation (CELIS) places a particular emphasis on modeling the inherent combinatorial nature of dense image segmentation problems.  We propose efficient algorithms for learning deep neural networks to model the energy function; and for local optimization of this energy in the space of supervoxel agglomerations.  We extensively evaluate our method on a publicly available 3-D microscopy dataset with 25 billion voxels of ground truth data. On an 11 billion voxel test set; we find that our method improves volumetric reconstruction accuracy by more than 20% as compared to two state-of-the-art baseline methods: graph-based segmentation of the output of a 3-D convolutional neural network trained to predict boundaries; as well as a random forest classifier trained to agglomerate supervoxels that were generated by a 3-D convolutional neural network.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6595-combinatorial-energy-learning-for-image-segmentation/bibtex,Jeremy B.

2016,Hierarchical Object Representation for Open-Ended Object Category Learning and Recognition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6539-hierarchical-object-representation-for-open-ended-object-category-learning-and-recognition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6539-hierarchical-object-representation-for-open-ended-object-category-learning-and-recognition,Most robots lack the ability to learn new objects from past experiences. To migrate a robot to a new environment one must often completely re-generate the knowledge- base that it is running with. Since in open-ended domains the set of categories to be learned is not predefined; it is not feasible to assume that one can pre-program all object categories required by robots. Therefore; autonomous robots must have the ability to continuously execute learning and recognition in a concurrent and interleaved fashion. This paper proposes an open-ended 3D object recognition system which concurrently learns both the object categories and the statistical features for encoding objects. In particular; we propose an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to learn structural semantic features (i.e. topics) from low-level feature co-occurrences for each category independently. Moreover; topics in each category are discovered in an unsupervised fashion and are updated incrementally using new object views. The approach contains similarities with the organization of the visual cortex and builds a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated representations. Results show the fulfilling performance of this approach on different types of objects. Moreover; this system demonstrates the capability of learning from few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6539-hierarchical-object-representation-for-open-ended-object-category-learning-and-recognition/bibtex,Seyed Hamidreza Kasaei; Ana Maria Tom?; Lu?s Seabra Lopes
2016,Adaptive optimal training of animal behavior,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6344-adaptive-optimal-training-of-animal-behavior.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6344-adaptive-optimal-training-of-animal-behavior,Neuroscience experiments often require training animals to perform tasks designed to elicit various sensory; cognitive; and motor behaviors. Training typically involves a series of gradual adjustments of stimulus conditions and rewards in order to bring about learning. However; training protocols are usually hand-designed; relying on a combination of intuition; guesswork; and trial-and-error; and often require weeks or months to achieve a desired level of task performance. Here we combine ideas from reinforcement learning and adaptive optimal experimental design to formulate methods for adaptive optimal training of animal behavior. Our work addresses two intriguing problems at once: first; it seeks to infer the learning rules underlying an animal's behavioral changes during training; second; it seeks to exploit these rules to select stimuli that will maximize the rate of learning toward a desired objective.  We develop and test these methods using data collected from rats during training on a two-interval sensory discrimination task.  We show that we can accurately infer the parameters of a policy-gradient-based learning algorithm that describes how the animal's internal model of the task evolves over the course of training.  We then formulate a theory for optimal training; which involves selecting sequences of stimuli that will drive the animal's internal policy toward a desired location in the parameter space. Simulations show that our method can in theory provide a substantial speedup over standard training methods. We feel these results will hold considerable theoretical and practical implications both for researchers in reinforcement learning and for experimentalists seeking to train animals.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6344-adaptive-optimal-training-of-animal-behavior/bibtex,Ji Hyun Bak; Jung Yoon Choi; Athena Akrami; Ilana Witten; Jonathan W.

This case is much more delicate than the setting covered by existing composition theorems; in which the algorithms themselves can be chosen adaptively; but the privacy parameters must be fixed up front. Indeed; it isn't even clear how to define differential privacy in the adaptive parameter setting. We proceed by defining two objects which cover the two main use cases of composition theorems. A privacy filter is a stopping time rule that allows an analyst to halt a computation before his pre-specified privacy budget is exceeded. A privacy odometer allows the analyst to track realized privacy loss as he goes; without needing to pre-specify a privacy budget. We show that unlike the case in which privacy parameters are fixed; in the adaptive parameter setting; these two use cases are distinct. We show that there exist privacy filters with bounds comparable (up to constants) with existing privacy composition theorems. We also give a privacy odometer that nearly matches non-adaptive private composition theorems; but is sometimes worse by a small asymptotic factor. Moreover; we show that this is inherent; and that any valid privacy odometer in the adaptive parameter setting must lose this factor; which shows a formal separation between the filter and odometer use-cases.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6170-privacy-odometers-and-filters-pay-as-you-go-composition/bibtex,Ryan M.

In this challenging task; an agent navigates through a website; which is represented as a graph consisting of web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as directed edges; to find a web page in which a query appears. The agent is required to have sophisticated high-level reasoning based on natural languages and efficient sequential decision-making capability to succeed. We release a software tool; called WebNav; that automatically transforms a website into this goal-driven web navigation task; and as an example; we make WikiNav; a dataset constructed from the English Wikipedia. We extensively evaluate different variants of neural net based artificial agents on WikiNav and observe that the proposed goal-driven web navigation well reflects the advances in models; making it a suitable benchmark for evaluating future progress. Furthermore; we extend the WikiNav with question-answer pairs from Jeopardy! and test the proposed agent based on recurrent neural networks against strong inverted index based search engines. The artificial agents trained on WikiNav outperforms the engined based approaches; demonstrating the capability of the proposed goal-driven navigation as a good proxy for measuring the progress in real-world tasks such as focused crawling and question-answering.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6064-end-to-end-goal-driven-web-navigation/bibtex,Rodrigo Nogueira; Kyunghyun Cho

Stochastic expression of colors in individual cells is a promising tool; although its use in the nervous system has been limited due to various sources of variability in expression. Moreover; the intermingled anatomy of neuronal trees is challenging for existing segmentation algorithms. Here; we propose a method to automate the segmentation of neurons in such (potentially pseudo-colored) images. The method uses spatio-color relations between the voxels; generates supervoxels to reduce the problem size by four orders of magnitude before the final segmentation; and is parallelizable over the supervoxels. To quantify performance and gain insight; we generate simulated images; where the noise level and characteristics; the density of expression; and the number of fluorophore types are variable. We also present segmentations of real Brainbow images of the mouse hippocampus; which reveal many of the dendritic segments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6549-automated-scalable-segmentation-of-neurons-from-multispectral-images/bibtex,Uygar S?mb?l; Douglas Roossien; Dawen Cai; Fei Chen; Nicholas Barry; John P.

The underlying mechanism resembles how people sample information from an image with their eye movements when making similar decisions. In this paper we incorporate the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return into the learned region sparsity model; thereby imposing diversity on the selected regions. We investigate how these mechanisms of sparsity and diversity relate to visual attention by testing our model on three different types of visual search tasks. We report state-of-the-art results in predicting the locations of human gaze fixations; even though our model is trained only on image-level labels without object location annotations. Notably; the classification performance of the extended model  remains the same as the original. This work suggests a new computational perspective on visual attention mechanisms and shows how the inclusion of attention-based mechanisms can improve computer vision techniques.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6451-learned-region-sparsity-and-diversity-also-predicts-visual-attention/bibtex,Zijun Wei; Hossein Adeli; Minh Hoai; Greg Zelinsky; Dimitris Samaras

This distance is based on the notion of embedding probabilities in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In this paper; we present the first known lower bounds for the estimation of MMD based on finite samples. Our lower bounds hold for any radial universal kernel on $\R^d$ and match the existing upper bounds up to constants that depend only on the properties of the kernel. Using these lower bounds; we establish the minimax rate optimality of the empirical estimator and its $U$-statistic variant; which are usually employed in applications.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6483-minimax-estimation-of-maximum-mean-discrepancy-with-radial-kernels/bibtex,Ilya O.

As these systems are becoming increasingly popular in industry; their outputs could affect business decision making; introducing incentives for an adversarial party to compromise the availability or integrity of such systems. We introduce a data poisoning attack on collaborative filtering systems.  We demonstrate how a powerful attacker with full knowledge of the learner can generate malicious data so as to maximize his/her malicious objectives; while at the same time mimicking normal user behaviors to avoid being detected. While the complete knowledge assumption seems extreme; it enables a robust assessment of the vulnerability of collaborative filtering schemes to highly motivated attacks. We present efficient solutions for two popular factorization-based collaborative filtering algorithms: the alternative minimization formulation and the nuclear norm minimization method. Finally; we test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on real-world data and discuss potential defensive strategies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6142-data-poisoning-attacks-on-factorization-based-collaborative-filtering/bibtex,Bo Li; Yining Wang; Aarti Singh; Yevgeniy Vorobeychik

That is; for the negative log-likelihood loss function; we show that the minimization of PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds maximizes the Bayesian marginal likelihood. This provides an alternative explanation to the Bayesian Occam's razor criteria; under the assumption that the data is generated by an i.i.d. distribution. Moreover; as the negative log-likelihood is an unbounded loss function; we motivate and propose a PAC-Bayesian theorem tailored for the sub-gamma loss family; and we show that our approach is sound on classical Bayesian linear regression tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6569-pac-bayesian-theory-meets-bayesian-inference/bibtex,Pascal Germain; Francis Bach; Alexandre Lacoste; Simon Lacoste-Julien

We formulate the regression problem as the minimization  of a least square criterion under a multilinear rank constraint; a difficult  non convex problem.  HOLRR computes efficiently an approximate solution of this problem; with solid theoretical guarantees. A kernel extension is also presented. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that HOLRR computes accurate solutions while being computationally very competitive.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6302-low-rank-regression-with-tensor-responses/bibtex,Guillaume Rabusseau; Hachem Kadri

These models require an agent to take actions based on observations (features) with the goal of achieving long-term performance competitive with a large set of policies.  To avoid barriers to sample-efficient learning associated with large observation spaces and general POMDPs; we focus on problems that can be summarized by a small number of hidden states and have long-term rewards that are predictable by a reactive function class.  In this setting; we design and analyze a new reinforcement learning algorithm; Least Squares Value Elimination by Exploration. We prove that the algorithm learns near optimal behavior after a number of episodes that is polynomial in all relevant parameters; logarithmic in the number of policies; and independent of the size of the observation space. Our result provides theoretical justification for reinforcement learning with function approximation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6575-pac-reinforcement-learning-with-rich-observations/bibtex,Akshay Krishnamurthy; Alekh Agarwal; John Langford
2016,Improved Deep Metric Learning with Multi-class N-pair Loss Objective,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6200-improved-deep-metric-learning-with-multi-class-n-pair-loss-objective.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6200-improved-deep-metric-learning-with-multi-class-n-pair-loss-objective,Deep metric learning has gained much popularity in recent years; following the success of deep learning. However; existing frameworks of deep metric learning based on contrastive loss and triplet loss often suffer from slow convergence; partially because they employ only one negative example while not interacting with the other negative classes in each update. In this paper; we propose to address this problem with a new metric learning objective called multi-class N-pair loss. The proposed objective function firstly generalizes triplet loss by allowing joint comparison among more than one negative examples ? more specifically; N-1 negative examples ? and secondly reduces the computational burden of evaluating deep embedding vectors via an efficient batch construction strategy using only N pairs of examples; instead of (N+1)?N. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed loss to the triplet loss as well as other competing loss functions for a variety of tasks on several visual recognition benchmark; including fine-grained object recognition and verification; image clustering and retrieval; and face verification and identification.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6200-improved-deep-metric-learning-with-multi-class-n-pair-loss-objective/bibtex,Kihyuk Sohn
2016,Bootstrap Model Aggregation for Distributed Statistical Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6049-bootstrap-model-aggregation-for-distributed-statistical-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6049-bootstrap-model-aggregation-for-distributed-statistical-learning,In distributed; or privacy-preserving learning; we are often given a set of probabilistic models estimated from different local repositories; and asked to combine them into a single model that gives efficient statistical estimation. A simple method is to linearly average the parameters of the local models; which; however; tends to be degenerate or not applicable on non-convex models; or models with different parameter dimensions. One more practical strategy is to generate bootstrap samples from the local models; and then learn a joint model based on the combined bootstrap set. Unfortunately; the bootstrap procedure introduces additional noise and can significantly deteriorate the performance. In this work; we propose two variance reduction methods to correct the bootstrap noise; including a weighted M-estimator that is both statistically efficient and practically powerful. Both theoretical and empirical analysis is provided to demonstrate our methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6049-bootstrap-model-aggregation-for-distributed-statistical-learning/bibtex,JUN HAN; Qiang Liu

The true cluster tree is estimated from a finite sample from an unknown true density. This paper addresses the basic question of quantifying our  uncertainty by assessing the statistical significance of different features of an empirical cluster tree. We first study a variety of metrics that can be used to compare different trees; analyzing their properties and assessing their suitability for our inference task. We then propose methods to construct and summarize confidence sets for the unknown true cluster tree. We introduce a partial ordering on cluster trees which we use to prune some of the statistically insignificant features of the empirical tree; yielding interpretable and parsimonious cluster trees. Finally; we provide a variety of simulations to illustrate our proposed methods and furthermore demonstrate their utility in the analysis of a Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) data set.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6508-statistical-inference-for-cluster-trees/bibtex,Jisu KIM; Yen-Chi Chen; Sivaraman Balakrishnan; Alessandro Rinaldo; Larry Wasserman
2016,A Bandit Framework for Strategic Regression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6190-a-bandit-framework-for-strategic-regression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6190-a-bandit-framework-for-strategic-regression,We consider a learner's problem of acquiring data dynamically for training a regression model; where the training data are collected from strategic data sources. A fundamental challenge is to incentivize data holders to exert effort to improve the quality of their reported data; despite that the quality is not directly verifiable by the learner. In this work; we study a dynamic data acquisition process where data holders can contribute multiple times. Using a bandit framework; we leverage on the long-term incentive of future job opportunities to incentivize high-quality contributions. We propose a Strategic Regression-Upper Confidence Bound (SR-UCB) framework; an UCB-style index combined with a simple payment rule; where the index of a worker approximates the quality of his past contributions and is used by the learner to determine whether the worker receives future work. For linear regression and certain family of non-linear regression problems; we show that SR-UCB enables a $O(\sqrt{\log T/T})$-Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) where each worker exerting a target effort level that the learner has chosen; with $T$ being the number of data acquisition stages. The SR-UCB framework also has some other desirable properties: (1) The indexes can be updated in an online fashion (hence computationally light). (2) A slight variant; namely Private SR-UCB (PSR-UCB); is able to preserve $(O(\log^{-1} T); O(\log^{-1} T))$-differential privacy for workers' data; with only a small compromise on incentives (achieving $O(\log^{6} T/\sqrt{T})$-BNE).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6190-a-bandit-framework-for-strategic-regression/bibtex,Yang Liu; Yiling Chen

Our main contribution is twofold: first; we present a rigorous graph-theoretic framework describing the connecting architectures of RNNs in general. Second; we propose three architecture complexity measures of RNNs: (a) the recurrent depth; which captures the RNN?s over-time nonlinear complexity; (b) the feedforward depth; which captures the local input-output nonlinearity (similar to the ?depth? in feedforward neural networks (FNNs)); and (c) the recurrent skip coefficient which captures how rapidly the information propagates over time. We rigorously prove each measure?s existence and computability. Our experimental results show that RNNs might benefit from larger recurrent depth and feedforward depth. We further demonstrate that increasing recurrent skip coefficient offers performance boosts on long term dependency problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6303-architectural-complexity-measures-of-recurrent-neural-networks/bibtex,Saizheng Zhang; Yuhuai Wu; Tong Che; Zhouhan Lin; Roland Memisevic; Ruslan R.

The properties of such time series can result in substantial uncertainty about the values of the underlying temporal processes; while making the data difficult to deal with using standard classification methods that assume fixed-dimensional feature spaces. To address these challenges; we propose an uncertainty-aware classification framework based on a special computational layer we refer to as the Gaussian process adapter that can connect irregularly sampled time series data to any black-box classifier learnable using gradient descent. We show how to scale up the required computations based on combining the structured kernel interpolation framework and the Lanczos approximation method; and how to discriminatively train the Gaussian process adapter in combination with a number of classifiers end-to-end using backpropagation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6475-a-scalable-end-to-end-gaussian-process-adapter-for-irregularly-sampled-time-series-classification/bibtex,Steven Cheng-Xian Li; Benjamin M.

2016,The Multi-fidelity Multi-armed Bandit,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6592-the-multi-fidelity-multi-armed-bandit.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6592-the-multi-fidelity-multi-armed-bandit,We study a variant of the classical stochastic $K$-armed bandit where observing the outcome of each arm is expensive; but cheap approximations to this outcome are available. For example; in online advertising the performance of an ad can be approximated by displaying it for shorter time periods or to narrower audiences. We formalise this task as a \emph{multi-fidelity} bandit; where; at each time step; the forecaster may choose to play an arm at any one of $M$ fidelities. The highest fidelity (desired outcome) expends cost $\costM$. The $m$\ssth fidelity (an approximation) expends $\costm < \costM$ and returns a biased estimate of the highest fidelity. We develop \mfucb; a novel upper confidence bound procedure for this setting and prove that it naturally adapts to the sequence of available approximations and costs thus attaining better regret than naive strategies which ignore the approximations. For instance; in the above online advertising example; \mfucbs would use the lower fidelities to quickly eliminate suboptimal ads and reserve the larger expensive experiments on a small set of promising candidates. We complement this result with a lower bound and show that \mfucbs is nearly optimal under certain conditions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6592-the-multi-fidelity-multi-armed-bandit/bibtex,Kirthevasan Kandasamy; Gautam Dasarathy; Barnabas Poczos; Jeff Schneider
2016,Anchor-Free Correlated Topic Modeling: Identifiability and Algorithm,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6308-anchor-free-correlated-topic-modeling-identifiability-and-algorithm.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6308-anchor-free-correlated-topic-modeling-identifiability-and-algorithm,In topic modeling; many algorithms that guarantee identifiability of the topics have been developed under the premise that there exist anchor words -- i.e.; words that only appear (with positive probability) in one topic. Follow-up work has resorted to three or higher-order statistics of the data corpus to relax the anchor word assumption. Reliable estimates of higher-order statistics are hard to obtain; however; and the identification of topics under those models hinges on uncorrelatedness of the topics; which can be unrealistic. This paper revisits topic modeling based on second-order moments; and proposes an anchor-free topic mining framework. The proposed approach guarantees the identification of the topics under a much milder condition compared to the anchor-word assumption; thereby exhibiting much better robustness in practice. The associated algorithm only involves one eigen-decomposition and a few small linear programs. This makes it easy to implement and scale up to very large problem instances. Experiments using the TDT2 and Reuters-21578 corpus demonstrate that the proposed anchor-free approach exhibits very favorable performance (measured using coherence; similarity count; and clustering accuracy metrics) compared to the prior art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6308-anchor-free-correlated-topic-modeling-identifiability-and-algorithm/bibtex,Kejun Huang; Xiao Fu; Nikolaos D.

Provably accurate solutions for PCA have been in use for a long time. However; to the best of our knowledge; all existing theoretical guarantees for it assume that the data and the corrupting noise  are mutually independent; or at least uncorrelated. This is valid in practice often; but not always. In this paper; we study the PCA problem in the setting where the data and noise can be correlated. Such noise is often also referred to as ``data-dependent noise". We obtain a correctness result for the standard eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) based solution to PCA under simple assumptions on the data-noise correlation. We also develop and analyze a generalization of EVD; cluster-EVD; that improves upon EVD in certain regimes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6598-correlated-pca-principal-components-analysis-when-data-and-noise-are-correlated/bibtex,Namrata Vaswani; Han Guo

These models can represent arbitrary distributions over binary variables; and thus generalize the commonly used pairwise Markov random fields and models with log-supermodular potentials only; for which efficient approximate inference algorithms are known. While inference in the considered models is #P-hard in general; we present efficient approximate algorithms exploiting recent advances in the field of discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a large set of experiments; where our model allows reasoning about preferences over sets of items with complements and substitutes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6225-variational-inference-in-mixed-probabilistic-submodular-models/bibtex,Josip Djolonga; Sebastian Tschiatschek; Andreas Krause

The most commonly used and studied variant maintains a diagonal matrix approximation to second order information by accumulating past gradients which are used to tune the step size adaptively. In certain situations the full-matrix variant of AdaGrad is expected to attain better performance; however in high dimensions it is computationally impractical. We present Ada-LR and RadaGrad two computationally efficient approximations to full-matrix AdaGrad based on randomized dimensionality reduction. They are able to capture dependencies between features and achieve similar performance to full-matrix AdaGrad but at a much smaller computational cost. We show that the regret of Ada-LR is close to the regret of full-matrix AdaGrad which can have an up-to exponentially smaller dependence on the dimension than the diagonal variant. Empirically; we show that Ada-LR and RadaGrad perform similarly to full-matrix AdaGrad. On the task of training convolutional neural networks as well as recurrent neural networks; RadaGrad achieves faster convergence than diagonal AdaGrad.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6054-scalable-adaptive-stochastic-optimization-using-random-projections/bibtex,Gabriel Krummenacher; Brian McWilliams; Yannic Kilcher; Joachim M.

This paper presents a simple and computationally efficient method that incorporates task reward into maximum likelihood training. We establish a connection between maximum likelihood and regularized expected reward; showing that they are approximately equivalent in the vicinity of the optimal solution. Then we show how maximum likelihood can be generalized by optimizing the conditional probability of auxiliary outputs that are sampled proportional to their exponentiated scaled rewards. We apply this framework to optimize edit distance in the output space; by sampling from edited targets. Experiments on speech recognition and machine translation for neural sequence to sequence models show notable improvements over maximum likelihood baseline by simply sampling from target output augmentations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6547-reward-augmented-maximum-likelihood-for-neural-structured-prediction/bibtex,Mohammad Norouzi; Samy Bengio; zhifeng Chen; Navdeep Jaitly; Mike Schuster; Yonghui Wu; Dale Schuurmans

We show that for any continuous function f; consistent estimators of the mean embedding of a random variable X lead to consistent estimators of the mean embedding of f(X). For Matern kernels and sufficiently smooth functions we also provide rates of convergence.  Our results extend to functions of multiple random variables. If the variables are dependent; we require an estimator of the mean embedding of their joint distribution as a starting point; if they are independent; it is sufficient to have separate estimators of the mean embeddings of their marginal distributions. In either case; our results cover both mean embeddings based on i.i.d. samples as well as "reduced set" expansions in terms of dependent expansion points. The latter serves as a justification for using such expansions to limit memory resources when applying the approach as a basis for probabilistic programming.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6545-consistent-kernel-mean-estimation-for-functions-of-random-variables/bibtex,Adam Scibior; Carl-Johann Simon-Gabriel; Ilya O.

This insight enables extension of HMC and slice sampling to a broader family of samplers; called Monomial Gamma Samplers (MGS). We provide a theoretical analysis of the mixing performance of such samplers; proving that in the limit of a single parameter; the MGS draws decorrelated samples from the desired target distribution. We further show that as this parameter tends toward this limit; performance gains are achieved at a cost of increasing numerical difficulty and some practical convergence issues.

However; learning a good representation of 3D objects is still an open problem due to the high dimensionality of the data and many factors of variation involved. In this work; we investigate the task of single-view 3D object reconstruction from a learning agent's perspective. We formulate the learning process as an interaction between 3D and 2D representations and propose an encoder-decoder network with a novel projection loss defined by the projective transformation. More importantly; the projection loss enables the unsupervised learning using 2D observation without explicit 3D supervision. We demonstrate the ability of the model in generating 3D volume from a single 2D image with three sets of experiments: (1) learning from single-class objects; (2) learning from multi-class objects and (3) testing on novel object classes. Results show superior performance and better generalization ability for 3D object reconstruction when the projection loss is involved.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6206-perspective-transformer-nets-learning-single-view-3d-object-reconstruction-without-3d-supervision/bibtex,Xinchen Yan; Jimei Yang; Ersin Yumer; Yijie Guo; Honglak Lee

For convex one-layer problems; we demonstrate an equivalence between global minimizers of the training problem and Nash equilibria in a simple game.  We then show how the game can be extended to general acyclic neural networks with differentiable convex gates; establishing a bijection between the Nash equilibria and critical (or KKT) points of the deep learning problem.

We propose a new stochastic first-order method; namely the accelerated stochastic compositional proximal gradient (ASC-PG) method; which updates based on queries to the sampling oracle using two different timescales. The ASC-PG is the first proximal gradient method for the stochastic composition problem that can deal with nonsmooth regularization penalty. We show that the ASC-PG exhibits faster convergence than the best known algorithms; and that it achieves the optimal sample-error complexity in several important special cases. We further demonstrate the application of ASC-PG to reinforcement learning  and conduct numerical experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6438-accelerating-stochastic-composition-optimization/bibtex,Mengdi Wang; Ji Liu; Ethan Fang

We study algorithms that minimize queue-regret: the (expected) difference between the queue-lengths obtained by the algorithm; and those obtained by a genie-aided matching algorithm that knows exact service rates.  A naive view of this problem would suggest that queue-regret should grow logarithmically: since queue-regret cannot be larger than classical regret; results for the standard MAB problem give algorithms that ensure queue-regret increases no more than logarithmically in time. Our paper shows surprisingly more complex behavior.  In particular; the naive intuition is correct as long as the bandit algorithm's queues have relatively long regenerative cycles: in this case queue-regret is similar to cumulative regret; and scales (essentially) logarithmically.  However; we show that this "early stage" of the queueing bandit eventually gives way to a "late stage"; where the optimal queue-regret scaling is O(1/t).  We demonstrate an algorithm that (order-wise) achieves this asymptotic queue-regret; and also exhibits close to optimal switching time from the early stage to the late stage.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6370-regret-of-queueing-bandits/bibtex,Subhashini Krishnasamy; Rajat Sen; Ramesh Johari; Sanjay Shakkottai

At each round; our algorithm selects a pair of functions; a base predictor and a base abstention function.  We define convex upper bounds for the natural loss function associated to this problem; which we prove to be calibrated with respect to the Bayes solution. Our algorithm benefits from general margin-based learning guarantees which we derive for ensembles of pairs of base predictor and abstention functions; in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding function classes.  We give convergence guarantees for our algorithm along with a linear-time weak-learning algorithm for abstention stumps. We also report the results of several experiments suggesting that our algorithm provides a significant improvement in practice over two confidence-based algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6336-boosting-with-abstention/bibtex,Corinna Cortes; Giulia DeSalvo; Mehryar Mohri

Training with stochastic gradient descent and variants requires careful parameter tuning and provides no guarantee to achieve the global optimum. In contrast we show under quite weak assumptions on the data that a particular class of feedforward  neural networks can be trained globally optimal with a linear convergence rate. Up to our knowledge this is the first practically feasible method which achieves such a guarantee. While the method can in principle be applied to deep networks; we restrict ourselves for simplicity in this paper to one- and two hidden layer networks. Our experiments confirms that these models are already rich enough to achieve good performance on a series of real-world datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6238-globally-optimal-training-of-generalized-polynomial-neural-networks-with-nonlinear-spectral-methods/bibtex,Antoine Gautier; Quynh N.

Learning to search is a family of methods where the complex decision problem is cast into a sequence of decisions via a search space. Although these methods have shown promise both in theory and in practice; implementing them has been burdensomely awkward. In this paper; we show the search space can be defined by an arbitrary imperative program; turning learning to search into a credit assignment compiler. Altogether with the algorithmic improvements for the compiler; we radically reduce the complexity of programming and the running time. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on multiple joint prediction tasks.

2016,Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit with General Reward Functions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6511-combinatorial-multi-armed-bandit-with-general-reward-functions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6511-combinatorial-multi-armed-bandit-with-general-reward-functions,In this paper; we study the stochastic combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework that allows a general nonlinear reward function; whose expected value may not depend only on the means of the input random variables but possibly on the entire distributions of these variables. Our framework enables a much larger class of reward functions such as the $\max()$ function and nonlinear utility functions. Existing techniques relying on accurate estimations of the means of random variables; such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) technique; do not work directly on these functions. We propose a new algorithm called stochastically dominant confidence bound (SDCB); which estimates the distributions of underlying random variables and their stochastically dominant confidence bounds. We prove that SDCB can achieve $O(\log T)$ distribution-dependent regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ distribution-independent regret; where $T$ is the time horizon. We apply our results to the $K$-MAX problem and expected utility maximization problems. In particular; for $K$-MAX; we provide the first polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for its offline problem; and give the first $\tilde{O}(\sqrt T)$ bound on the $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation regret of its online problem; for any $\epsilon>0$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6511-combinatorial-multi-armed-bandit-with-general-reward-functions/bibtex,Wei Chen; Wei Hu; Fu Li; Jian Li; Yu Liu; Pinyan Lu
2016,Exploiting the Structure: Stochastic Gradient Methods Using Raw Clusters,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6403-exploiting-the-structure-stochastic-gradient-methods-using-raw-clusters.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6403-exploiting-the-structure-stochastic-gradient-methods-using-raw-clusters,The amount of data available in the world is growing faster than our ability to deal with it. However; if we take advantage of the internal structure; data may become much smaller for machine learning purposes. In this paper we focus on one of the fundamental machine learning tasks; empirical risk minimization (ERM); and provide faster algorithms with the help from the clustering structure of the data.  We introduce a simple notion of raw clustering that can be efficiently computed from the data; and propose two algorithms based on clustering information. Our accelerated algorithm ClusterACDM is built on a novel Haar transformation applied to the dual space of the ERM problem; and our variance-reduction based algorithm ClusterSVRG introduces a new gradient estimator using clustering. Our algorithms outperform their classical counterparts ACDM and SVRG respectively.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6403-exploiting-the-structure-stochastic-gradient-methods-using-raw-clusters/bibtex,Zeyuan Allen-Zhu; Yang Yuan; Karthik Sridharan
2016,A Non-convex One-Pass Framework for Generalized Factorization Machine and Rank-One Matrix Sensing,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6410-a-non-convex-one-pass-framework-for-generalized-factorization-machine-and-rank-one-matrix-sensing.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6410-a-non-convex-one-pass-framework-for-generalized-factorization-machine-and-rank-one-matrix-sensing,We develop an efficient alternating framework for learning a generalized version of Factorization Machine (gFM) on steaming data with provable guarantees. When the instances are sampled from $d$ dimensional random Gaussian vectors and the target second order coefficient matrix in gFM is of rank $k$; our algorithm converges linearly; achieves $O(\epsilon)$ recovery error after retrieving $O(k^{3}d\log(1/\epsilon))$ training instances; consumes $O(kd)$ memory in one-pass of dataset and only requires matrix-vector product operations in each iteration. The key ingredient of our framework is a construction of an estimation sequence  endowed with a so-called Conditionally Independent RIP condition (CI-RIP). As special cases of gFM; our framework can be applied to symmetric or asymmetric rank-one matrix sensing problems; such as inductive matrix completion and phase retrieval.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6410-a-non-convex-one-pass-framework-for-generalized-factorization-machine-and-rank-one-matrix-sensing/bibtex,Ming Lin; Jieping Ye
2016,Robustness of classifiers: from adversarial to random noise,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6331-robustness-of-classifiers-from-adversarial-to-random-noise.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6331-robustness-of-classifiers-from-adversarial-to-random-noise,Several recent works have shown that state-of-the-art classifiers are vulnerable to worst-case (i.e.; adversarial) perturbations of the datapoints. On the other hand; it has been empirically observed that these same classifiers are relatively robust to random noise. In this paper; we propose to study a semi-random noise regime that generalizes both the random and worst-case noise regimes. We propose the first quantitative analysis of the robustness of nonlinear classifiers in this general noise regime. We establish precise theoretical bounds on the robustness of classifiers in this general regime; which depend on the curvature of the classifier's decision boundary. Our bounds confirm and quantify the empirical observations that classifiers satisfying curvature constraints are robust to random noise. Moreover; we quantify the robustness of classifiers in terms of the subspace dimension in the semi-random noise regime; and show that our bounds remarkably interpolate between the worst-case and random noise regimes. We perform experiments and show that the derived bounds provide very accurate estimates when applied to various state-of-the-art deep neural networks and datasets. This result suggests bounds on the curvature of the classifiers' decision boundaries that we support experimentally; and more generally offers important insights onto the geometry of high dimensional classification problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6331-robustness-of-classifiers-from-adversarial-to-random-noise/bibtex,Alhussein Fawzi; Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli; Pascal Frossard
2016,On Valid Optimal Assignment Kernels and Applications to Graph Classification,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6166-on-valid-optimal-assignment-kernels-and-applications-to-graph-classification.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6166-on-valid-optimal-assignment-kernels-and-applications-to-graph-classification,The success of kernel methods has initiated the design of novel positive semidefinite functions; in particular for structured data. A leading design paradigm for this is the convolution kernel; which decomposes structured objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels; in contrast; are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts; which can provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however; optimal assignments yield indefinite functions; which complicates their use in kernel methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6166-on-valid-optimal-assignment-kernels-and-applications-to-graph-classification/bibtex,Nils M.

2016,Multiple-Play Bandits in the Position-Based Model,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6546-multiple-play-bandits-in-the-position-based-model.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6546-multiple-play-bandits-in-the-position-based-model,Sequentially learning to place items in multi-position displays or lists is a task that can be cast into the multiple-play semi-bandit setting. However; a major concern in this context is when the system cannot decide whether the user feedback for each item is actually exploitable. Indeed; much of the content may have been simply ignored by the user. The present work proposes to exploit available information regarding the display position bias under the so-called Position-based click model (PBM). We first discuss how this model differs from the Cascade model and its variants considered in several recent works on multiple-play bandits. We then provide a novel regret lower bound for this model as well as computationally efficient algorithms that display good empirical and theoretical performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6546-multiple-play-bandits-in-the-position-based-model/bibtex,Paul Lagr?e; Claire Vernade; Olivier Cappe

We believe that both (1) and (2) are necessary for a truly general skill learning framework; which is a key building block needed to scale up to lifelong learning agents. The ASAP framework is also able to  solve related new tasks simply by adapting where it applies its existing learned skills. We prove that ASAP converges to a local optimum under natural conditions. Finally; our experimental results; which include a RoboCup domain; demonstrate the ability of ASAP to learn where to reuse skills as well as solve multiple tasks with considerably less experience than solving each task from scratch.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6350-adaptive-skills-adaptive-partitions-asap/bibtex,Daniel J.

This generalizes the problem of learning to predict the purchasing behavior of a rational agent who has an unknown objective function; that has been studied under the name ?Learning from Revealed Preferences". We give mistake bound learning algorithms in two settings: in the first; the objective of the LP is known to the learner but there is an arbitrary; fixed set of constraints which are unknown. Each example is defined by an additional known constraint and the goal of the learner is to predict the optimal solution of the LP given the union of the known and unknown constraints. This models the problem of predicting the behavior of a rational agent whose goals are known; but whose resources are unknown. In the second setting; the objective of the LP is unknown; and changing in a controlled way. The constraints of the LP may also change every day; but are known. An example is given by a set of constraints and partial information about the objective; and the task of the learner is again to predict the optimal solution of the partially known LP.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6150-learning-from-rational-behavior-predicting-solutions-to-unknown-linear-programs/bibtex,Shahin Jabbari; Ryan M.

We reduce the complexity of algorithm design for machine learning by reductions:  we develop reductions that take a method developed for one setting and apply it to the entire spectrum of smoothness and strong-convexity in applications.  Furthermore; unlike existing results; our new reductions are OPTIMAL and more PRACTICAL. We show how these new reductions give rise to new and faster running times on training linear classifiers for various families of loss functions; and conclude with experiments showing their successes also in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6364-optimal-black-box-reductions-between-optimization-objectives/bibtex,Zeyuan Allen-Zhu; Elad Hazan

We first extend the half-trek criterion to cover a broader class of models and apply our extension to finding testable constraints implied by the model. We then show that any semi-Markovian linear model can be recursively decomposed into simpler sub-models; resulting in improved identification and constraint discovery power. Finally; we show that; unlike the existing methods developed for linear models; the resulting method subsumes the identification and constraint discovery algorithms for non-parametric models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6223-identification-and-overidentification-of-linear-structural-equation-models/bibtex,Bryant Chen

We focus on learning tree structured potential games where equilibria are represented by local maxima of an underlying potential function. We cast the learning problem within a max margin setting and show that the problem is NP-hard even when the strategic interactions form a tree. We develop a variant of dual decomposition to estimate the underlying game and demonstrate with synthetic and real decision/voting data that the game theoretic perspective (carving out local maxima) enables meaningful recovery.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6152-learning-tree-structured-potential-games/bibtex,Vikas Garg; Tommi Jaakkola
2016,Observational-Interventional Priors for Dose-Response Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6107-observational-interventional-priors-for-dose-response-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6107-observational-interventional-priors-for-dose-response-learning,Controlled interventions provide the most direct source of information for learning causal effects. In particular; a dose-response curve can be learned by varying the treatment level and observing the corresponding outcomes. However; interventions can be expensive and time-consuming. Observational data; where the treatment is not controlled by a known mechanism; is sometimes available. Under some strong assumptions; observational data allows for the estimation of dose-response curves. Estimating such curves nonparametrically is hard: sample sizes for controlled interventions may be small; while in the observational case a large number of measured confounders may need to be marginalized. In this paper; we introduce a hierarchical Gaussian process prior that constructs a distribution over the dose-response curve by learning from observational data; and reshapes the distribution with a nonparametric affine transform learned from controlled interventions. This function composition from different sources is shown to speed-up learning; which we demonstrate with a thorough sensitivity analysis and an application to modeling the effect of therapy on cognitive skills of premature infants.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6107-observational-interventional-priors-for-dose-response-learning/bibtex,Ricardo Silva
2016,Generating Long-term Trajectories Using Deep Hierarchical Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6520-generating-long-term-trajectories-using-deep-hierarchical-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6520-generating-long-term-trajectories-using-deep-hierarchical-networks,We study the problem of modeling spatiotemporal trajectories over long time horizons using expert demonstrations. For instance; in sports; agents often choose action sequences with long-term goals in mind; such as achieving a certain strategic position. Conventional policy learning approaches; such as those based on Markov decision processes; generally fail at learning cohesive long-term behavior in such high-dimensional state spaces; and are only effective when fairly myopic decision-making yields the desired behavior. The key difficulty is that conventional models are ``single-scale'' and only learn a single state-action policy. We instead propose a hierarchical policy class that automatically reasons about both long-term and short-term goals; which we instantiate as a hierarchical neural network. We showcase our approach in a case study on learning to imitate demonstrated basketball trajectories; and show that it generates significantly more realistic trajectories compared to non-hierarchical baselines as judged by professional sports analysts.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6520-generating-long-term-trajectories-using-deep-hierarchical-networks/bibtex,Stephan Zheng; Yisong Yue; Jennifer Hobbs

The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) and the Variational Free Energy (VFE) approximations are two recent popular methods. Despite superficial similarities; these approximations have surprisingly different theoretical properties and behave differently in practice. We thoroughly investigate the two methods for regression both analytically and through illustrative examples; and draw conclusions to guide practical application.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6477-understanding-probabilistic-sparse-gaussian-process-approximations/bibtex,Matthias Bauer; Mark van der Wilk; Carl Edward Rasmussen
2016,Structured Sparse Regression via Greedy Hard Thresholding,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6425-structured-sparse-regression-via-greedy-hard-thresholding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6425-structured-sparse-regression-via-greedy-hard-thresholding,Several learning applications require solving high-dimensional regression problems where the relevant features belong to a small number of (overlapping) groups. For very large datasets and under standard sparsity constraints; hard thresholding methods have proven to be extremely efficient; but such methods require NP hard projections when dealing with overlapping groups. In this paper; we show that such NP-hard projections can not only be avoided by appealing to submodular optimization; but such methods come with strong theoretical guarantees even in the presence of poorly conditioned data (i.e. say when two features have correlation  $\geq 0.99$); which existing analyses cannot handle. These methods exhibit an interesting computation-accuracy trade-off and can be extended to significantly harder problems such as sparse overlapping groups. Experiments on both real and synthetic data validate our claims and demonstrate that the proposed methods are orders of magnitude faster than other greedy and convex relaxation techniques for learning with group-structured sparsity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6425-structured-sparse-regression-via-greedy-hard-thresholding/bibtex,Prateek Jain; Nikhil Rao; Inderjit S.

SEBOOST applies a secondary optimization process in the subspace spanned by the last steps and descent directions. The method was inspired by the SESOP optimization method for large-scale problems; and has been adapted for the stochastic learning framework. It can be applied on top of any existing optimization method with no need to tweak the internal algorithm. We show that the method is able to boost the performance of different algorithms; and make them more robust to changes in their hyper-parameters. As the boosting steps of SEBOOST are applied between large sets of descent steps; the additional subspace optimization hardly increases the overall computational burden. We introduce two hyper-parameters that control the balance between the baseline method and the secondary optimization process. The method was evaluated on several deep learning tasks; demonstrating promising results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6109-seboost-boosting-stochastic-learning-using-subspace-optimization-techniques/bibtex,Elad Richardson; Rom Herskovitz; Boris Ginsburg; Michael Zibulevsky
2016,Simple and Efficient Weighted Minwise Hashing,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6472-simple-and-efficient-weighted-minwise-hashing.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6472-simple-and-efficient-weighted-minwise-hashing,Weighted minwise hashing (WMH) is one of the fundamental subroutine; required by many celebrated approximation algorithms; commonly adopted in industrial practice for large -scale search and learning. The resource bottleneck with WMH is the computation of multiple (typically a few hundreds to thousands) independent hashes of the data.  We propose a simple rejection type sampling scheme based on a carefully designed red-green map; where we show that the number of rejected sample has exactly the same distribution as weighted minwise sampling. The running time of our method;  for many practical datasets; is an order of magnitude smaller than existing methods. Experimental evaluations; on real datasets; show that for computing 500 WMH; our proposal can be 60000x faster than the Ioffe's method without losing any accuracy. Our method is also around 100x faster than approximate heuristics capitalizing on the efficient ``densified" one permutation hashing schemes~\cite{Proc:OneHashLSH_ICML14;Proc:Shrivastava_UAI14}. Given the simplicity of our approach and its significant advantages; we hope that it will replace existing implementations in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6472-simple-and-efficient-weighted-minwise-hashing/bibtex,Anshumali Shrivastava

The algorithm greedily shrinks a sum of truncated variances within a set of potential maximizers (BO) or unclassified points (LSE); which is updated based on confidence bounds.  TruVaR is effective in several important settings that are typically non-trivial to incorporate into myopic algorithms; including pointwise costs and heteroscedastic noise.  We provide a general theoretical guarantee for TruVaR covering these aspects; and use it to recover and strengthen existing results on BO and LSE.  Moreover; we provide a new result for a setting where one can select from a number of noise levels having associated costs.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both synthetic and real-world data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6080-truncated-variance-reduction-a-unified-approach-to-bayesian-optimization-and-level-set-estimation/bibtex,Ilija Bogunovic; Jonathan Scarlett; Andreas Krause; Volkan Cevher

We present applications of this learning scenario to convex and non-convex objectives for structured prediction and analyze them as stochastic first-order methods. We present an experimental evaluation on problems of natural language processing over exponential output spaces; and compare convergence speed across different objectives under the practical criterion of optimal task performance on development data and the optimization-theoretic criterion of minimal squared gradient norm. Best results under both criteria are obtained for a non-convex objective for pairwise preference learning under bandit feedback.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6134-stochastic-structured-prediction-under-bandit-feedback/bibtex,Artem Sokolov; Julia Kreutzer; Stefan Riezler; Christopher Lo

Specifically; we focus on the problem of exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning. Drawing inspiration from the intrinsic motivation literature; we use density models to measure uncertainty; and propose a novel algorithm for deriving a pseudo-count from an arbitrary density model. This technique enables us to generalize count-based exploration algorithms to the non-tabular case. We apply our ideas to Atari 2600 games; providing sensible pseudo-counts from raw pixels. We transform these pseudo-counts into exploration bonuses and obtain significantly improved exploration in a number of hard games; including the infamously difficult Montezuma's Revenge.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6383-unifying-count-based-exploration-and-intrinsic-motivation/bibtex,Marc Bellemare; Sriram Srinivasan; Georg Ostrovski; Tom Schaul; David Saxton; Remi Munos

In particular; using the multiclass formulation of boosting and SVM we note that both use a combination of mapping and linear classification to maximize the multiclass margin. In SVM this is implemented using a pre-defined mapping (induced by the kernel) and optimizing the linear classifiers. In boosting the linear classifiers are pre-defined and the mapping (predictor) is learned through combination of weak learners. We argue that the intermediate mapping; e.g. boosting predictor; is preserving the discriminant aspects of the data and by controlling the dimension of this mapping it is possible to achieve discriminant low dimensional representations for the data. We use the aforementioned duality and propose a new method; Large Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LADDER) that jointly learns the mapping and the linear classifiers in an efficient manner. This leads to a data-driven mapping which can embed data into any number of dimensions. Experimental results show that this embedding can significantly improve performance on tasks such as hashing and image/scene classification.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6458-large-margin-discriminant-dimensionality-reduction-in-prediction-space/bibtex,Mohammad Saberian; Jose Costa Pereira; Can Xu; Jian Yang; Nuno Nvasconcelos

Bounding the treewidth of a Bayesian network greatly reduces the complexity of inferences.  Yet; being a global property of the graph; it considerably increases the difficulty of the learning process. Our novel algorithm accomplishes this task; scaling both to large domains and to large treewidths.

Traditional code optimisation strategies used in compilers are based on applying pre-specified set of transformations that make the code faster to execute without changing its semantics. In contrast; our work involves adapting programs to make them more efficient while considering correctness only on a target input distribution. Our approach is inspired by the recent works on differentiable representations of programs. We show that it is possible to compile programs written in a low-level  language to a differentiable representation. We also show how programs in this representation can be optimised to make them efficient on a target distribution of inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables learning specifically-tuned algorithms for given data distributions with a high success rate.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6411-adaptive-neural-compilation/bibtex,Rudy R.

2016,Synthesis of MCMC and Belief Propagation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6318-synthesis-of-mcmc-and-belief-propagation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6318-synthesis-of-mcmc-and-belief-propagation,Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Belief Propagation (BP) are the most popular algorithms for computational inference in Graphical Models (GM).  In principle; MCMC is an exact probabilistic method which; however; often suffers from exponentially slow mixing. In contrast; BP  is a deterministic method; which is typically fast;  empirically very successful; however in general lacking control of accuracy over loopy graphs.  In this paper; we introduce MCMC algorithms correcting the approximation error of BP; i.e.;  we provide a way to compensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC.  Our framework is based on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach  which allows to express the BP error  as a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series is computationally intractable;  it is known that a truncated series; summing up all 2-regular loops; is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise binary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically. Motivated by this; we; first; propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme for the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models.  Our main idea here is to use the Worm algorithm; known to provide fast mixing in other (related) problems; and then  design an appropriate rejection scheme to sample 2-regular loops. Furthermore; we also design an efficient rejection-free MCMC scheme  for approximating the full series.  The main novelty underlying our design  is in utilizing the concept of cycle basis; which provides an efficient decomposition of the generalized loops. In essence; the proposed MCMC schemes run on transformed GM built upon  the non-trivial BP solution; and our experiments show that this synthesis of BP and MCMC  outperforms both direct MCMC and bare BP schemes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6318-synthesis-of-mcmc-and-belief-propagation/bibtex,Sung-Soo Ahn; Michael Chertkov; Jinwoo Shin

Recently; surrogate-based Bayesian optimization (BO) sub-solvers have been successfully deployed in the AL framework for a more global search in the presence of inequality constraints; however a drawback was that expected improvement (EI) evaluations relied on Monte Carlo. Here we introduce an alternative slack variable AL; and show that in this formulation the EI may be evaluated with library routines. The slack variables furthermore facilitate equality as well as inequality constraints; and mixtures thereof. We show our new slack "ALBO" compares favorably to the original. Its superiority over conventional alternatives is reinforced on several new mixed constraint examples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6439-bayesian-optimization-under-mixed-constraints-with-a-slack-variable-augmented-lagrangian/bibtex,Victor Picheny; Robert B.

Our main technical contribution centers around a novel training method; called Multibatch; for similarity learning; i.e.; for the task of generating an invariant ``face signature'' through training pairs of ``same'' and ``not-same'' face images. The Multibatch method first generates signatures for a mini-batch of $k$ face images and then constructs an unbiased estimate of the full gradient by relying on all $k^2-k$ pairs from the mini-batch. We prove that the variance of the Multibatch estimator is bounded by $O(1/k^2)$; under some mild conditions. In contrast; the standard gradient estimator that relies on random $k/2$ pairs has a variance of order $1/k$. The smaller variance of the Multibatch estimator significantly speeds up the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent.  Using the Multibatch method we train a deep convolutional neural network that achieves an accuracy of $98.2\%$ on the LFW benchmark; while its prediction runtime takes only $30$msec on a single ARM Cortex A9 core. Furthermore; the entire training process took only 12 hours on a single Titan X GPU.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6524-learning-a-metric-embedding-for-face-recognition-using-the-multibatch-method/bibtex,Oren Tadmor; Tal Rosenwein; Shai Shalev-Shwartz; Yonatan Wexler; Amnon Shashua
2016,Catching heuristics are optimal control policies,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6548-catching-heuristics-are-optimal-control-policies.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6548-catching-heuristics-are-optimal-control-policies,Two seemingly contradictory theories attempt to explain how humans move to intercept an airborne ball. One theory posits that humans predict the ball trajectory to optimally plan future actions; the other claims that; instead of performing such complicated computations; humans employ heuristics to reactively choose appropriate actions based on immediate visual feedback. In this paper; we show that interception strategies appearing to be heuristics can be understood as computational solutions to the optimal control problem faced by a ball-catching agent acting under uncertainty. Modeling catching as a continuous partially observable Markov decision process and employing stochastic optimal control theory; we discover that the four main heuristics described in the literature are optimal solutions if the catcher has sufficient time to continuously visually track the ball. Specifically; by varying model parameters such as noise; time to ground contact; and perceptual latency; we show that different strategies arise under different circumstances. The catcher's policy switches between generating reactive and predictive behavior based on the ratio of system to observation noise and the ratio between reaction time and task duration. Thus; we provide a rational account of human ball-catching behavior and a unifying explanation for seemingly contradictory theories of target interception on the basis of stochastic optimal control.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6548-catching-heuristics-are-optimal-control-policies/bibtex,Boris Belousov; Gerhard Neumann; Constantin A.

2016,A Pseudo-Bayesian Algorithm for Robust PCA,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6435-a-pseudo-bayesian-algorithm-for-robust-pca.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6435-a-pseudo-bayesian-algorithm-for-robust-pca,Commonly used in many applications; robust PCA represents an algorithmic attempt to reduce the sensitivity of classical PCA to outliers.  The basic idea is to learn a decomposition of some data matrix of interest into low rank and sparse components; the latter representing unwanted outliers.  Although the resulting problem is typically NP-hard; convex relaxations provide a computationally-expedient alternative with theoretical support.  However; in practical regimes performance guarantees break down and a variety of non-convex alternatives; including Bayesian-inspired models; have been proposed to boost estimation quality.  Unfortunately though; without additional a priori knowledge none of these methods can significantly expand the critical operational range such that exact principal subspace recovery is possible.  Into this mix we propose a novel pseudo-Bayesian algorithm that explicitly compensates for design weaknesses in many existing non-convex approaches leading to state-of-the-art performance with a sound analytical foundation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6435-a-pseudo-bayesian-algorithm-for-robust-pca/bibtex,Tae-Hyun Oh; Yasuyuki Matsushita; In Kweon; David Wipf

Unlike traditional kernel methods where data representation is decoupled from the prediction task; we learn how to shape the kernel with supervision. We proceed by first proposing improvements of the recently-introduced convolutional kernel networks (CKNs) in the context of unsupervised learning; then; we derive backpropagation rules to take advantage of labeled training data. The resulting model is a new type of convolutional neural network; where optimizing the filters at each layer is equivalent to learning a linear subspace in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We show that our method achieves reasonably competitive performance for image classification on some standard ``deep learning'' datasets such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN; and also for image super-resolution; demonstrating the applicability of our approach to a large variety of image-related tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6184-end-to-end-kernel-learning-with-supervised-convolutional-kernel-networks/bibtex,Julien Mairal

While the algorithmic extension is straightforward; it comes with challenges and opportunities: (a) the convex minimization analysis does not apply and we use the notion of monotone operators to prove convergence; showing in particular that the same algorithm applies to a larger class of problems; such as variational inequalities;  (b) there are two notions of splits; in terms of functions; or in terms of partial derivatives; (c) the split does need to be done with convex-concave terms; (d) non-uniform sampling is key to an efficient algorithm; both in theory and practice; and (e)  these incremental algorithms can be easily accelerated using a simple extension of the "catalyst" framework;  leading to an algorithm which is always superior to accelerated batch algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6471-stochastic-variance-reduction-methods-for-saddle-point-problems/bibtex,Balamurugan Palaniappan; Francis Bach
2016,Preference Completion from Partial Rankings,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6272-preference-completion-from-partial-rankings.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6272-preference-completion-from-partial-rankings,We propose a novel and efficient algorithm for the collaborative preference completion problem; which involves jointly estimating individualized rankings for a set of entities over a shared set of items; based on a limited number of observed affinity values. Our approach exploits the observation that while preferences are often recorded as numerical scores; the predictive quantity of interest is the underlying rankings. Thus; attempts to closely match the recorded scores may lead to overfitting and impair generalization performance. Instead; we propose an estimator that directly fits the underlying preference order; combined with nuclear norm constraints to encourage low--rank parameters.  Besides (approximate) correctness of the ranking order; the proposed estimator makes no generative assumption on the numerical scores of the observations. One consequence is that  the proposed estimator can fit any consistent partial ranking over a subset of the items represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG); generalizing standard techniques that can only fit preference scores. Despite this generality; for supervision representing total or blockwise total orders; the computational complexity of our algorithm is within a $\log$ factor of the standard algorithms for nuclear norm regularization based estimates for matrix completion. We further show promising empirical results for a novel and challenging application of collaboratively ranking of the associations between brain--regions and cognitive neuroscience terms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6272-preference-completion-from-partial-rankings/bibtex,Suriya Gunasekar; Oluwasanmi O.

2016,Dynamic Network Surgery for Efficient DNNs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6165-dynamic-network-surgery-for-efficient-dnns.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6165-dynamic-network-surgery-for-efficient-dnns,Deep learning has become a ubiquitous technology to improve machine intelligence. However; most of the existing deep models are structurally very complex; making them difficult to be deployed on the mobile platforms with limited computational power. In this paper; we propose a novel network compression method called dynamic network surgery; which can remarkably reduce the network complexity by making on-the-fly connection pruning. Unlike the previous methods which accomplish this task in a greedy way; we properly incorporate connection splicing into the whole process to avoid incorrect pruning and make it as a continual network maintenance. The effectiveness of our method is proved with experiments. Without any accuracy loss; our method can efficiently compress the number of parameters in LeNet-5 and AlexNet by a factor of $\bm{108}\times$ and $\bm{17.7}\times$ respectively; proving that it outperforms the recent pruning method by considerable margins.

2016,Deep Learning Models of the Retinal Response to Natural Scenes,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6388-deep-learning-models-of-the-retinal-response-to-natural-scenes.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6388-deep-learning-models-of-the-retinal-response-to-natural-scenes,A central challenge in sensory neuroscience is to understand neural computations and circuit mechanisms that underlie the encoding of ethologically relevant; natural stimuli. In multilayered neural circuits; nonlinear processes such as synaptic transmission and spiking dynamics present a significant obstacle to the creation of accurate computational models of responses to natural stimuli. Here we demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture retinal responses to natural scenes nearly to within the variability of a cell's response; and are markedly more accurate than linear-nonlinear (LN) models and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Moreover; we find two additional surprising properties of CNNs: they are less susceptible to overfitting than their LN counterparts when trained on small amounts of data; and generalize better when tested on stimuli drawn from a different distribution (e.g. between natural scenes and white noise). An examination of the learned CNNs reveals several properties.  First; a richer set of feature maps is necessary for predicting the responses to natural scenes compared to white noise.  Second; temporally precise responses to slowly varying inputs originate from feedforward inhibition; similar to known retinal mechanisms. Third; the injection of latent noise sources in intermediate layers enables our model to capture the sub-Poisson spiking variability observed in retinal ganglion cells.  Fourth; augmenting our CNNs with recurrent lateral connections enables them to capture contrast adaptation as an emergent property of accurately describing retinal responses to natural scenes.  These methods can be readily generalized to other sensory modalities and stimulus ensembles. Overall; this work demonstrates that CNNs not only accurately capture sensory circuit responses to natural scenes; but also can yield information about the circuit's internal structure and function.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6388-deep-learning-models-of-the-retinal-response-to-natural-scenes/bibtex,Lane McIntosh; Niru Maheswaranathan; Aran Nayebi; Surya Ganguli; Stephen Baccus
2016,Achieving the KS threshold in the general stochastic block model with linearized acyclic belief propagation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6365-achieving-the-ks-threshold-in-the-general-stochastic-block-model-with-linearized-acyclic-belief-propagation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6365-achieving-the-ks-threshold-in-the-general-stochastic-block-model-with-linearized-acyclic-belief-propagation,The stochastic block model (SBM) has long been studied in machine learning and network science as a canonical model for clustering and community detection. In the recent years; new developments have demonstrated the presence of threshold phenomena for this model; which have set new challenges for algorithms. For the {\it detection} problem in symmetric SBMs; Decelle et al.\ conjectured that the so-called Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold can be achieved efficiently. This was proved for two communities; but remained open from three communities. We prove this conjecture here; obtaining a more general result that applies to arbitrary SBMs with linear size communities. The developed algorithm is a linearized acyclic belief propagation (ABP) algorithm; which mitigates the effects of cycles while provably achieving the KS threshold in $O(n \ln n)$ time. This extends prior methods by achieving universally the KS threshold while reducing or preserving the computational complexity. ABP is also connected to a power iteration method on a generalized nonbacktracking operator; formalizing the spectral-message passing interplay described in Krzakala et al.; and extending results from Bordenave et al.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6365-achieving-the-ks-threshold-in-the-general-stochastic-block-model-with-linearized-acyclic-belief-propagation/bibtex,Emmanuel Abbe; Colin Sandon

We argue that; when incorporating distance bounds into a mini-batch algorithm; already used data should preferentially be reused. To this end we propose using nested mini-batches; whereby data in a mini-batch at iteration t is automatically reused at iteration t+1.   Using nested mini-batches presents two difficulties. The first is that unbalanced use of data can bias estimates; which we resolve by ensuring that each data sample contributes exactly once to centroids. The second is in choosing mini-batch sizes; which we address by balancing premature fine-tuning of centroids with redundancy induced slow-down. Experiments show that the resulting nmbatch algorithm is very effective; often arriving within 1\% of the empirical minimum 100 times earlier than the standard mini-batch algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6481-nested-mini-batch-k-means/bibtex,James Newling; Fran?ois Fleuret

We introduce Hoeffding-like concentration inequalities that hold for a random; adaptively chosen number of samples. Our inequalities are tight under natural assumptions and can greatly simplify the analysis of common sequential decision problems. In particular; we apply them to sequential hypothesis testing; best arm identification; and sorting. The resulting algorithms rival or exceed the state of the art both theoretically and empirically.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6493-adaptive-concentration-inequalities-for-sequential-decision-problems/bibtex,Shengjia Zhao; Enze Zhou; Ashish Sabharwal; Stefano Ermon

However; statistical methods for their concurrent analysis are currently lacking. Here we introduce such techniques in a framework based on vine copulas with mixed margins to construct multivariate stochastic models. These models can describe detailed mixed interactions between discrete variables such as neural spike counts; and continuous variables such as local field potentials. We propose efficient methods for likelihood calculation; inference; sampling and mutual information estimation within this framework. We test our methods on simulated data and demonstrate applicability on mixed data generated by a biologically realistic neural network. Our methods hold the promise to considerably improve statistical analysis of neural data recorded simultaneously at different scales.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6069-mixed-vine-copulas-as-joint-models-of-spike-counts-and-local-field-potentials/bibtex,Arno Onken; Stefano Panzeri
2016,Optimal Tagging with Markov Chain Optimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6041-optimal-tagging-with-markov-chain-optimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6041-optimal-tagging-with-markov-chain-optimization,Many information systems use tags and keywords to describe and annotate content. These allow for efficient organization and categorization of items; as well as facilitate relevant search queries. As such; the selected set of tags for an item can have a considerable effect on the volume of traffic that eventually reaches an item.  In tagging systems where tags are exclusively chosen by an item's owner; who in turn is interested in maximizing traffic; a principled approach for assigning tags can prove valuable. In this paper we introduce the problem of optimal tagging; where the task is to choose a subset of tags for a new item such that the probability of browsing users reaching that item is maximized.  We formulate the problem by modeling traffic using a Markov chain; and asking how transitions in this chain should be modified to maximize traffic into a certain state of interest. The resulting optimization problem involves maximizing a certain function over subsets; under a cardinality constraint.  We show that the optimization problem is NP-hard; but has a (1-1/e)-approximation via a simple greedy algorithm due to monotonicity and submodularity. Furthermore; the structure of the problem allows for an efficient computation of the greedy step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method; we perform experiments on three tagging datasets; and show that the greedy algorithm outperforms other baselines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6041-optimal-tagging-with-markov-chain-optimization/bibtex,Nir Rosenfeld; Amir Globerson

However; such methods require a user-defined kernel as input. We extend the randomized-feature approach to the task of learning a kernel (via its associated random features). Specifically; we present an efficient optimization problem that learns a kernel in a supervised manner. We prove the consistency of the estimated kernel as well as generalization bounds for the class of estimators induced by the optimized kernel; and we experimentally evaluate our technique on several datasets. Our approach is efficient and highly scalable; and we attain competitive results with a fraction of the training cost of other techniques.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6180-learning-kernels-with-random-features/bibtex,Aman Sinha; John C.

2016,Crowdsourced Clustering: Querying Edges vs Triangles,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6499-crowdsourced-clustering-querying-edges-vs-triangles.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6499-crowdsourced-clustering-querying-edges-vs-triangles,We consider the task of clustering items using answers from non-expert crowd workers. In such cases; the workers are often not able to label the items directly; however; it is reasonable to assume that they can compare items and judge whether they are similar or not. An important question is what queries to make; and we compare two types: random edge queries; where a pair of items is revealed; and random triangles; where a triple is. Since it is far too expensive to query all possible edges and/or triangles; we need to work with partial observations subject to a fixed query budget constraint. When a generative model for the data is available (and we consider a few of these) we determine the cost of a query by its entropy; when such models do not exist we use the average response time per query of the workers as a surrogate for the cost. In addition to theoretical justification; through several simulations and experiments on two real data sets on Amazon Mechanical Turk; we empirically demonstrate that; for a fixed budget; triangle queries uniformly outperform edge queries. Even though; in contrast to edge queries; triangle queries reveal dependent edges; they provide more reliable edges and; for a fixed budget; many more of them. We also provide a sufficient condition on the number of observations; edge densities inside and outside the clusters and the minimum cluster size required for the exact recovery of the true adjacency matrix via triangle queries using a convex optimization-based clustering algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6499-crowdsourced-clustering-querying-edges-vs-triangles/bibtex,Ramya Korlakai Vinayak; Babak Hassibi

The proposal   combines constraint-based program synthesis with sampling via random   parity constraints.

We develop a family of UCB-style dueling bandit algorithms for such general tournament solutions; and show $O(\log T)$ anytime regret bounds for them.

Recently a conditional random field auto-encoder has been proposed in a two-layer setting; allowing latent structured representation to be automatically inferred.  Aside from being nonconvex; it also requires the demanding inference of normalization.  In this paper; we develop a convex relaxation of two-layer conditional model which captures latent structure and estimates model parameters; jointly and optimally.  We further expand its applicability by resorting to a weaker form of inference---maximum a-posteriori.  The flexibility of the model is demonstrated on two structures based on total unimodularity---graph matching and linear chain.  Experimental results confirm the promise of the method.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6314-convex-two-layer-modeling-with-latent-structure/bibtex,Vignesh Ganapathiraman; Xinhua Zhang; Yaoliang Yu; Junfeng Wen

For estimating such connectivity; magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are well-suited tools because of their millisecond temporal resolution. However; localizing source activity in the brain requires solving an under-determined linear problem. In typical two-step approaches; researchers first solve the linear problem with general priors assuming independence across ROIs; and secondly quantify cross-region connectivity. In this work; we propose a one-step state-space model to improve estimation of dynamic connectivity. The model treats the mean activity in individual ROIs as the state variable; and describes non-stationary dynamic dependence across ROIs using time-varying auto-regression. Compared with a two-step method; which first obtains the commonly used minimum-norm estimates of source activity; and then fits the auto-regressive model; our state-space model yielded smaller estimation errors on simulated data where the model assumptions held. When applied on empirical MEG data from one participant in a scene-processing experiment; our state-space model also demonstrated intriguing preliminary results; indicating leading and lagged linear dependence between the early visual cortex and a higher-level scene-sensitive region; which could reflect feed-forward and feedback information flow within the visual cortex during scene processing.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6593-a-state-space-model-of-cross-region-dynamic-connectivity-in-megeeg/bibtex,Ying Yang; Elissa Aminoff; Michael Tarr; Kass E.

2016,A Communication-Efficient Parallel Algorithm for Decision Tree,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6381-a-communication-efficient-parallel-algorithm-for-decision-tree.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6381-a-communication-efficient-parallel-algorithm-for-decision-tree,Decision tree (and its extensions such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and Random Forest) is a widely used machine learning algorithm; due to its practical effectiveness and model interpretability. With the emergence of big data; there is an increasing need to parallelize the training process of decision tree. However; most existing attempts along this line suffer from high communication costs. In this paper; we propose a new algorithm; called \emph{Parallel Voting Decision Tree (PV-Tree)}; to tackle this challenge. After partitioning the training data onto a number of (e.g.; $M$) machines; this algorithm performs both local voting and global voting in each iteration. For local voting; the top-$k$ attributes are selected from each machine according to its local data. Then; the indices of these top attributes are aggregated by a server; and the globally top-$2k$ attributes are determined by a majority voting among these local candidates. Finally; the full-grained histograms of the globally top-$2k$ attributes are collected from local machines in order to identify the best (most informative) attribute and its split point. PV-Tree can achieve a very low communication cost (independent of the total number of attributes) and thus can scale out very well. Furthermore; theoretical analysis shows that this algorithm can learn a near optimal decision tree; since it can find the best attribute with a large probability. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that PV-Tree significantly outperforms the existing parallel decision tree algorithms in the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6381-a-communication-efficient-parallel-algorithm-for-decision-tree/bibtex,Qi Meng; Guolin Ke; Taifeng Wang; Wei Chen; Qiwei Ye; Zhi-Ming Ma; Tieyan Liu
2016,What Makes Objects Similar: A Unified Multi-Metric Learning Approach,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6192-what-makes-objects-similar-a-unified-multi-metric-learning-approach.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6192-what-makes-objects-similar-a-unified-multi-metric-learning-approach,Linkages are essentially determined by similarity measures that may be derived from multiple perspectives. For example; spatial linkages are usually generated based on localities of heterogeneous data; whereas semantic linkages can come from various properties; such as different physical meanings behind social relations. Many existing metric learning models focus on spatial linkages; but leave the rich semantic factors unconsidered. Similarities based on these models are usually overdetermined on linkages. We propose a Unified Multi-Metric Learning (UM2L) framework to exploit multiple types of metrics. In UM2L; a type of combination operator is introduced for distance characterization from multiple perspectives; and thus can introduce flexibilities for representing and utilizing both spatial and semantic linkages. Besides; we propose a uniform solver for UM2L which is guaranteed to converge. Extensive experiments on diverse applications exhibit the superior classification performance and comprehensibility of UM2L. Visualization results also validate its ability on physical meanings discovery.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6192-what-makes-objects-similar-a-unified-multi-metric-learning-approach/bibtex,Han-Jia Ye; De-Chuan Zhan; Xue-Min Si; Yuan Jiang; Zhi-Hua Zhou
2016,Local Similarity-Aware Deep Feature Embedding,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6368-local-similarity-aware-deep-feature-embedding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6368-local-similarity-aware-deep-feature-embedding,Existing deep embedding methods in vision tasks are capable of learning a compact Euclidean space from images; where Euclidean distances correspond to a similarity metric. To make learning more effective and efficient; hard sample mining is usually employed; with samples identified through computing the Euclidean feature distance. However; the global Euclidean distance cannot faithfully characterize the true feature similarity in a complex visual feature space; where the intraclass distance in a high-density region may be larger than the interclass distance in low-density regions. In this paper; we introduce a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit; which is capable of learning a similarity metric adaptive to local feature structure. The metric can be used to select genuinely hard samples in a local neighborhood to guide the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The new layer is appealing in that it is pluggable to any convolutional networks and is trained end-to-end. Our local similarity-aware feature embedding not only demonstrates faster convergence and boosted performance on two complex image retrieval datasets; its large margin nature also leads to superior generalization results under the large and open set scenarios of transfer learning and zero-shot learning on ImageNet 2010 and ImageNet-10K datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6368-local-similarity-aware-deep-feature-embedding/bibtex,Chen Huang; Chen Change Loy; Xiaoou Tang

In both cases; we prove that two simple greedy algorithms are not near-optimal but the best between them is near-optimal if the utility function satisfies pointwise submodularity and pointwise cost-sensitive submodularity respectively. This implies a combined algorithm that is near-optimal with respect to the optimal algorithm that uses half of the budget. We discuss applications of our theoretical results and also report experiments comparing the greedy algorithms on the active learning problem.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6526-adaptive-maximization-of-pointwise-submodular-functions-with-budget-constraint/bibtex,Nguyen Cuong; Huan Xu

Rather than plugging a consistent density estimate (which requires k ? ? as the sample size n ? ?) into the functional of interest; the estimators we consider fix k and perform a bias correction. This can be more efficient computationally; and; as we show; statistically; leading to faster convergence rates. Our framework unifies several previous estimators; for most of which ours are the first finite sample guarantees.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6123-finite-sample-analysis-of-fixed-k-nearest-neighbor-density-functional-estimators/bibtex,Shashank Singh; Barnabas Poczos
2016,Homotopy Smoothing for Non-Smooth Problems with Lower Complexity than O(1/\epsilon),Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6407-homotopy-smoothing-for-non-smooth-problems-with-lower-complexity-than-o1epsilon.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6407-homotopy-smoothing-for-non-smooth-problems-with-lower-complexity-than-o1epsilon,In this paper; we develop a novel {\bf ho}moto{\bf p}y  {\bf s}moothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth problems that is composed of a non-smooth term with an explicit max-structure and  a smooth term or  a simple non-smooth term whose proximal mapping is easy to compute. The best known iteration complexity for solving such non-smooth optimization problems is $O(1/\epsilon)$ without any assumption on the strong convexity. In this work; we will show that the proposed  HOPS achieved a lower iteration complexity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^{1-\theta})$ with $\theta\in(0;1]$ capturing the local sharpness of the objective function around the optimal solutions. To the best of our knowledge; this is the lowest iteration complexity achieved so far for the considered non-smooth optimization problems without strong convexity assumption.  The HOPS algorithm employs Nesterov's smoothing technique and Nesterov's accelerated gradient method and runs in stages; which gradually decreases the smoothing parameter in a stage-wise manner until it yields a sufficiently good approximation of the original function. We show that HOPS enjoys a linear convergence for many well-known non-smooth problems (e.g.; empirical risk minimization with a piece-wise linear loss function and $\ell_1$ norm regularizer; finding a point in a polyhedron; cone programming; etc). Experimental results verify the effectiveness of HOPS in comparison with Nesterov's smoothing algorithm and the primal-dual style of first-order methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6407-homotopy-smoothing-for-non-smooth-problems-with-lower-complexity-than-o1epsilon/bibtex,Yi Xu; Yan Yan; Qihang Lin; Tianbao Yang

Although N data is missing; it sometimes outperforms PN learning (i.e.; ordinary supervised learning). Hitherto; neither theoretical nor experimental analysis has been given to explain this phenomenon. In this paper; we theoretically compare PU (and NU) learning against PN learning based on the upper bounds on estimation errors. We find simple conditions when PU and NU learning are likely to outperform PN learning; and we prove that; in terms of the upper bounds; either PU or NU learning (depending on the class-prior probability and the sizes of P and N data) given infinite U data will improve on PN learning. Our theoretical findings well agree with the experimental results on artificial and benchmark data even when the experimental setup does not match the theoretical assumptions exactly.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6354-theoretical-comparisons-of-positive-unlabeled-learning-against-positive-negative-learning/bibtex,Gang Niu; Marthinus Christoffel du Plessis; Tomoya Sakai; Yao Ma; Masashi Sugiyama

The new results show that recent upper bounds that either (a) hold with high-probability or (b) depend on the total loss of the best arm or (c) depend on the quadratic variation of the losses; are close to tight. Besides this we prove two impossibility results. First; the existence of a single arm that is optimal in every round cannot improve the regret in the worst case. Second; the regret cannot scale with the effective range of the losses. In contrast; both results are possible in the full-information setting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6277-refined-lower-bounds-for-adversarial-bandits/bibtex,S?bastien Gerchinovitz; Tor Lattimore
2016,Dense Associative Memory for Pattern Recognition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6121-dense-associative-memory-for-pattern-recognition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6121-dense-associative-memory-for-pattern-recognition,A model of associative memory is studied; which stores and reliably retrieves many more patterns than the number of neurons in the network.  We propose a simple duality between this dense associative memory and neural networks commonly used in deep learning. On the associative memory side of this duality; a family of models that smoothly interpolates between two limiting cases can be constructed.  One limit is referred to as the feature-matching mode of pattern recognition; and the other one as the prototype regime. On the deep learning side of the duality; this family corresponds to feedforward neural networks with one hidden layer and various activation functions; which transmit the activities of the visible neurons to the hidden layer. This family of activation functions includes logistics; rectified linear units; and rectified polynomials of higher degrees. The proposed duality makes it possible to apply energy-based intuition from associative memory to analyze computational properties of neural networks with unusual activation functions - the higher rectified polynomials which until now have not been used in deep learning. The utility of the dense memories is illustrated for two test cases: the logical gate XOR and the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6121-dense-associative-memory-for-pattern-recognition/bibtex,Dmitry Krotov; John J.

Our formalism combines multi-arm bandits and causal inference to model a novel type of bandit feedback that is not exploited by existing approaches. We propose a new algorithm that exploits the causal feedback and prove a bound on its simple regret that is strictly better (in all quantities) than algorithms that do not use the additional causal information.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6195-causal-bandits-learning-good-interventions-via-causal-inference/bibtex,Finnian Lattimore; Tor Lattimore; Mark D.

2016,Multi-view Anomaly Detection via Robust Probabilistic Latent Variable Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6456-multi-view-anomaly-detection-via-robust-probabilistic-latent-variable-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6456-multi-view-anomaly-detection-via-robust-probabilistic-latent-variable-models,We propose probabilistic latent variable models for multi-view anomaly detection; which is the task of finding instances that have inconsistent views given multi-view data. With the proposed model; all views of a non-anomalous instance are assumed to be generated from a single latent vector. On the other hand; an anomalous instance is assumed to have multiple latent vectors; and its different views are generated from different latent vectors. By inferring the number of latent vectors used for each instance with Dirichlet process priors; we obtain multi-view anomaly scores. The proposed model can be seen as a robust extension of probabilistic canonical correlation analysis for noisy multi-view data. We present Bayesian inference procedures for the proposed model based on a stochastic EM algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated in terms of performance when detecting multi-view anomalies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6456-multi-view-anomaly-detection-via-robust-probabilistic-latent-variable-models/bibtex,Tomoharu Iwata; Makoto Yamada

We present three variants of GC-LDA; each of which associates topics with a different spatial representation; and apply them to a corpus of neuroimaging data. In the context of this dataset; each topic corresponds to a functional brain region; where the region's spatial extent is captured by a probability distribution over neural activity; and the region's cognitive function is captured by a probability distribution over linguistic terms. We illustrate the qualitative improvements offered by GC-LDA in terms of the types of topics extracted with alternative spatial representations; as well as the model's ability to incorporate a-priori knowledge from the neuroimaging literature. We furthermore demonstrate that the novel features of GC-LDA improve predictions for missing data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6274-generalized-correspondence-lda-models-gc-lda-for-identifying-functional-regions-in-the-brain/bibtex,Timothy Rubin; Oluwasanmi O.

However; creating large labeled datasets is a very costly and time-consuming task. Semi-supervised learning uses unlabeled data to train a model with higher accuracy when there is a limited set of labeled data available. In this paper; we consider the problem of semi-supervised learning with convolutional neural networks. Techniques such as randomized data augmentation; dropout and random max-pooling provide better generalization and stability for classifiers that are trained using gradient descent. Multiple passes of an individual sample through the network might lead to different predictions due to the non-deterministic behavior of these techniques. We propose an unsupervised loss function that takes advantage of the stochastic nature of these methods and minimizes the difference between the predictions of multiple passes of a training sample through the network. We evaluate the proposed method on several benchmark datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6333-regularization-with-stochastic-transformations-and-perturbations-for-deep-semi-supervised-learning/bibtex,Mehdi Sajjadi; Mehran Javanmardi; Tolga Tasdizen

These methods scale to large datasets by using noisy gradients calculated using a mini-batch or subset of the dataset. However; the high variance inherent in these noisy gradients degrades performance and leads to slower mixing. In this paper; we present techniques for reducing variance in stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics; yielding novel  stochastic Monte Carlo methods that improve performance by reducing the variance in the stochastic gradient. We show that our proposed method has better theoretical guarantees on convergence rate than stochastic Langevin dynamics. This is complemented by impressive empirical results obtained on  a variety of real world datasets; and on four different machine learning tasks (regression; classification; independent component analysis and mixture modeling). These theoretical and empirical contributions combine to make a compelling case for using variance reduction in stochastic Monte Carlo methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6293-variance-reduction-in-stochastic-gradient-langevin-dynamics/bibtex,Kumar Avinava Dubey; Sashank J.

We propose XOR_MMAP; a novel approach to solve the Marginal MAP problem; which represents the intractable counting subproblem with queries to NP oracles; subject to additional parity constraints. XOR_MMAP provides a constant factor approximation to the Marginal MAP problem; by encoding it as a single optimization in a  polynomial size of the original problem. We evaluate our approach in several machine learning and decision-making applications; and show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art Marginal MAP solvers.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6462-solving-marginal-map-problems-with-np-oracles-and-parity-constraints/bibtex,Yexiang Xue; Zhiyuan Li; Stefano Ermon; Carla P.

Surprisingly; unlike the smooth case; our knowledge of this fundamental problem is very limited. For example; it is not known whether the proximal stochastic gradient method with constant minibatch converges to a stationary point. To tackle this issue; we develop fast stochastic algorithms that provably converge to a stationary point for constant minibatches. Furthermore; using a variant of these algorithms; we obtain provably faster convergence than batch proximal gradient descent. Our results are based on the recent variance reduction techniques for convex optimization but with a novel analysis for handling nonconvex and nonsmooth functions. We also prove global linear convergence rate for an interesting subclass of nonsmooth nonconvex functions; which subsumes several recent works.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6116-proximal-stochastic-methods-for-nonsmooth-nonconvex-finite-sum-optimization/bibtex,Sashank J.

Our density estimate is a piecewise constant function defined on a binary partition of $\Omega$.  The key ingredient of the algorithm is to use discrepancy; a concept originates from Quasi Monte Carlo analysis; to control the partition process. The resulting algorithm is simple; efficient; and has  provable convergence rate. We demonstrate empirically its efficiency as a density estimation method. We also show how it can be utilized to find good initializations for k-means.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6217-density-estimation-via-discrepancy-based-adaptive-sequential-partition/bibtex,Dangna Li; Kun Yang; Wing Hung Wong

While there are methods with optimality guarantees in the setting of discrete state and action spaces; these methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional deep RL scenarios. As such; most contemporary RL relies on simple heuristics such as epsilon-greedy exploration or adding Gaussian noise to the controls. This paper introduces Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME); an exploration strategy based on maximization of information gain about the agent's belief of environment dynamics. We propose a practical implementation; using variational inference in Bayesian neural networks which efficiently handles continuous state and action spaces. VIME modifies the MDP reward function; and can be applied with several different underlying RL algorithms. We demonstrate that VIME achieves significantly better performance compared to heuristic exploration methods across a variety of continuous control tasks and algorithms; including tasks with very sparse rewards.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6591-vime-variational-information-maximizing-exploration/bibtex,Rein Houthooft; Xi Chen; Xi Chen; Yan Duan; John Schulman; Filip De Turck; Pieter Abbeel

Previous studies have shown that feed-forward hierarchical models of the visual cortex provide a good fit to human visual decisions. At the same time; recent work in computer vision has demonstrated significant gains in object recognition accuracy with increasingly deep hierarchical architectures. But it is unclear how well these models account for human visual decisions and what they may reveal about the underlying brain processes.      We have conducted a large-scale psychophysics study to assess the correlation between computational models and human behavioral responses on a rapid animal vs. non-animal categorization task. We considered visual representations of varying complexity by analyzing the output of different stages of processing in three state-of-the-art deep networks. We found that recognition accuracy increases with higher stages of visual processing (higher level stages indeed outperforming human participants on the same task) but that human decisions agree best with predictions from intermediate stages.       Overall; these results suggest that human participants may rely on visual features of intermediate complexity and that the complexity of visual representations afforded by modern deep network models may exceed the complexity of those used by human participants during rapid categorization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6218-how-deep-is-the-feature-analysis-underlying-rapid-visual-categorization/bibtex,Sven Eberhardt; Jonah G.

In this paper; we propose doubly convolutional neural networks (DCNNs); which significantly improve the performance of CNNs by further exploring this idea. In stead of allocating a set of convolutional filters that are independently learned; a DCNN maintains groups of filters where filters within each group are translated versions of each other. Practically; a DCNN can be easily implemented by a two-step convolution procedure; which is supported by most modern deep learning libraries. We perform extensive experiments on three image classification benchmarks: CIFAR-10; CIFAR-100 and ImageNet; and show that DCNNs consistently outperform other competing architectures. We have also verified that replacing a convolutional layer with a doubly convolutional layer at any depth of a CNN can improve its performance. Moreover; various design choices of DCNNs are demonstrated; which shows that DCNN can serve the dual purpose of building more accurate models and/or reducing the memory footprint without sacrificing the accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6340-doubly-convolutional-neural-networks/bibtex,Shuangfei Zhai; Yu Cheng; Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang; Weining Lu

In this paper; we focus instead on batch methods that use a sizeable fraction of the training set at each iteration to facilitate parallelism; and that employ second-order information. In order to improve the learning process; we follow a multi-batch approach in which the batch changes at each iteration. This can cause difficulties because L-BFGS employs gradient differences to update the Hessian approximations; and when these gradients are computed using different data points the process can be unstable. This paper shows how to perform stable quasi-Newton updating in the multi-batch setting; illustrates the behavior of the algorithm in a distributed computing platform; and studies its convergence properties for both the convex and nonconvex cases.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6145-a-multi-batch-l-bfgs-method-for-machine-learning/bibtex,Albert S.

2016,Direct Feedback Alignment Provides Learning in Deep Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6441-direct-feedback-alignment-provides-learning-in-deep-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6441-direct-feedback-alignment-provides-learning-in-deep-neural-networks,Artificial neural networks are most commonly trained with the back-propagation algorithm; where the gradient for learning is provided by back-propagating the error; layer by layer; from the output layer to the hidden layers. A recently discovered method called feedback-alignment shows that the weights used for propagating the error backward don't have to be symmetric with the weights used for propagation the activation forward. In fact; random feedback weights work evenly well; because the network learns how to make the feedback useful. In this work; the feedback alignment principle is used for training hidden layers more independently from the rest of the network; and from a zero initial condition. The error is propagated through fixed random feedback connections directly from the output layer to each hidden layer. This simple method is able to achieve zero training error even in convolutional networks and very deep networks; completely without error back-propagation. The method is a step towards biologically plausible machine learning because the error signal is almost local; and no symmetric or reciprocal weights are required. Experiments show that the test performance on MNIST and CIFAR is almost as good as those obtained with back-propagation for fully connected networks. If combined with dropout; the method achieves 1.45% error on the permutation invariant MNIST task.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6441-direct-feedback-alignment-provides-learning-in-deep-neural-networks/bibtex,Arild N?kland

This new family of variational methods unifies a number of existing approaches; and enables a smooth interpolation from the evidence lower-bound to the log (marginal) likelihood that is controlled by the value of alpha that parametrises the divergence. The reparameterization trick; Monte Carlo approximation and stochastic optimisation methods are deployed to obtain a tractable and unified framework for optimisation. We further consider negative alpha values and propose a novel variational inference method as a new special case in the proposed framework.

Yet a major difficulty with these models is their tendency to overfit; with dropout shown to fail when applied to recurrent layers. Recent results at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and deep learning offer a Bayesian interpretation of common deep learning techniques such as dropout. This grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of the theoretical results; offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models. We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models; assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new approach outperforms existing techniques; and to the best of our knowledge improves on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank (73.4 test perplexity).

We propose a novel graphical model; namely Latent Differential Graph Model; where the networks under two different conditions are represented by two semiparametric elliptical distributions respectively; and the variation of these two networks (i.e.; differential graph) is characterized by the difference between their latent precision matrices. We propose an estimator for the differential graph based on quasi likelihood maximization with nonconvex regularization. We show that our estimator attains a faster statistical rate in parameter estimation than the state-of-the-art methods; and enjoys oracle property under mild conditions.

However; all of these results suffer from two significant shortcomings: i) large memory requirement due to the need to store an explicit convex decomposition of the current iterate; and as a consequence; large running-time overhead per iteration ii) the worst case convergence rate depends unfavorably on the dimension In this work we present a new conditional gradient variant and a corresponding analysis that improves on both of the above shortcomings. In particular; both memory and computation overheads are only linear in the dimension; and in addition; in case the optimal solution is sparse; the new convergence rate replaces a factor which is at least linear in the dimension in previous works; with a linear dependence on the number of non-zeros in the optimal solution At the heart of our method; and corresponding analysis; is a novel way to compute decomposition-invariant away-steps. While our theoretical guarantees do not apply to any polytope; they apply to several important structured polytopes that capture central concepts such as paths in graphs; perfect matchings in bipartite graphs; marginal distributions that arise in structured prediction tasks; and more. Our theoretical findings are complemented by empirical evidence that shows that our method delivers state-of-the-art performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6115-linear-memory-and-decomposition-invariant-linearly-convergent-conditional-gradient-algorithm-for-structured-polytopes/bibtex,Dan Garber; Dan Garber; Ofer Meshi
2016,Safe and Efficient Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6538-safe-and-efficient-off-policy-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6538-safe-and-efficient-off-policy-reinforcement-learning,In this work; we take a fresh look at some old and new algorithms for off-policy; return-based reinforcement learning. Expressing these in a common form; we derive a novel algorithm; Retrace(lambda); with three desired properties: (1) it has low variance; (2) it safely uses samples collected from any behaviour policy; whatever its degree of "off-policyness"; and (3) it is efficient as it makes the best use of samples collected from near on-policy behaviour policies. We analyse the contractive nature of the related operator under both off-policy policy evaluation and control settings and derive online sample-based algorithms. We believe this is the first return-based off-policy control algorithm converging a.s. to Q* without the GLIE assumption (Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration). As a corollary; we prove the convergence of Watkins' Q(lambda); which was  an open problem since 1989. We illustrate the benefits of Retrace(lambda) on a standard suite of Atari 2600 games.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6538-safe-and-efficient-off-policy-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Remi Munos; Tom Stepleton; Anna Harutyunyan; Marc Bellemare
2016,Fast ?-free Inference of Simulation Models with Bayesian Conditional Density Estimation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6084-fast-free-inference-of-simulation-models-with-bayesian-conditional-density-estimation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6084-fast-free-inference-of-simulation-models-with-bayesian-conditional-density-estimation,Many statistical models can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods are used to infer properties of these models from data. Traditionally these methods approximate the posterior over parameters by conditioning on data being inside an ?-ball around the observed data; which is only correct in the limit ??0. Monte Carlo methods can then draw samples from the approximate posterior to approximate predictions or error bars on parameters. These algorithms critically slow down as ??0; and in practice draw samples from a broader distribution than the posterior. We propose a new approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesian conditional density estimation. Preliminary inferences based on limited simulation data are used to guide later simulations. In some cases; learning an accurate parametric representation of the entire true posterior distribution requires fewer model simulations than Monte Carlo ABC methods need to produce a single sample from an approximate posterior.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6084-fast-free-inference-of-simulation-models-with-bayesian-conditional-density-estimation/bibtex,George Papamakarios; Iain Murray

Here we develop an approach for L1 distance that begins with an explicit and exact embedding of the points into L2. We show how this embedding can efficiently be combined with random projection methods for L2 NN search; such as locality-sensitive hashing or random projection trees. We rigorously establish the correctness of the methodology and show by experimentation that it is competitive in practice with available alternatives.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6227-an-algorithm-for-l1-nearest-neighbor-search-via-monotonic-embedding/bibtex,Xinan Wang; Sanjoy Dasgupta

They also include; as special cases; L^2 quantities which are used in many applications. We propose and analyze a family of estimators for Sobolev quantities of unknown probability density functions. We bound the finite-sample bias and variance of our estimators; finding that they are generally minimax rate-optimal. Our estimators are significantly more computationally tractable than previous estimators; and exhibit a statistical/computational trade-off allowing them to adapt to computational constraints. We also draw theoretical connections to recent work on fast two-sample testing and empirically validate our estimators on synthetic data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6369-efficient-nonparametric-smoothness-estimation/bibtex,Shashank Singh; Simon S.

Traditional methods for this problem assume just the availability of this single function. However; in many cases; cheap approximations to $\func$ may be obtainable. For example; the expensive real world behaviour of a robot can be approximated by a cheap computer simulation. We can use these approximations to eliminate low function value regions cheaply and use the expensive evaluations of $\func$ in a small but promising region and speedily identify the optimum. We formalise this task as a \emph{multi-fidelity} bandit problem where the target function and its approximations are sampled from a Gaussian process. We develop \mfgpucb; a novel method based on upper confidence bound techniques. In our theoretical analysis we demonstrate that it exhibits precisely the above behaviour; and achieves better regret than strategies which ignore multi-fidelity information. \mfgpucbs outperforms such naive strategies and other multi-fidelity methods  on several synthetic and real experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6118-gaussian-process-bandit-optimisation-with-multi-fidelity-evaluations/bibtex,Kirthevasan Kandasamy; Gautam Dasarathy; Junier B.

Inspired by the loop perforation technique from source code optimization; we speed up the bottleneck convolutional layers by skipping their evaluation in some of the spatial positions. We propose and analyze several strategies of choosing these positions. We demonstrate that perforation can accelerate modern convolutional networks such as AlexNet and VGG-16 by a factor of 2x - 4x.

2016,Differential Privacy without Sensitivity,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6050-differential-privacy-without-sensitivity.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6050-differential-privacy-without-sensitivity,The exponential mechanism is a general method to construct a randomized estimator that satisfies $(\varepsilon; 0)$-differential privacy. Recently; Wang et al. showed that the Gibbs posterior; which is a data-dependent probability distribution that contains the Bayesian posterior; is essentially equivalent to the exponential mechanism under certain boundedness conditions on the loss function. While the exponential mechanism provides a way to build an $(\varepsilon; 0)$-differential private algorithm; it requires boundedness of the loss function; which is quite stringent for some learning problems. In this paper; we focus on $(\varepsilon; \delta)$-differential privacy of Gibbs posteriors with convex and Lipschitz loss functions. Our result extends the classical exponential mechanism; allowing the loss functions to have an unbounded sensitivity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6050-differential-privacy-without-sensitivity/bibtex,Kentaro Minami; HItomi Arai; Issei Sato; Hiroshi Nakagawa
2016,Optimal Cluster Recovery in the Labeled Stochastic Block Model,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6196-optimal-cluster-recovery-in-the-labeled-stochastic-block-model.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6196-optimal-cluster-recovery-in-the-labeled-stochastic-block-model,We consider the problem of community detection or clustering in the labeled Stochastic Block Model (LSBM) with a finite number $K$ of clusters of sizes linearly growing with the global population of items $n$. Every pair of items is labeled independently at random; and label $\ell$ appears with probability $p(i;j;\ell)$ between two items in clusters indexed by $i$ and $j$; respectively. The objective is to reconstruct the clusters from the observation of these random labels.   Clustering under the SBM and their extensions has attracted much attention recently. Most existing work aimed at characterizing the set of parameters such that it is possible to infer clusters either positively correlated with the true clusters; or with a vanishing proportion of misclassified items; or exactly matching the true clusters. We find  the set of parameters such that there exists a clustering algorithm with at most $s$ misclassified items in average under the general LSBM and for any $s=o(n)$; which solves one open problem raised in \cite{abbe2015community}. We further develop an algorithm; based on simple spectral methods; that achieves this fundamental performance limit within $O(n \mbox{polylog}(n))$ computations and without the a-priori knowledge of the model parameters.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6196-optimal-cluster-recovery-in-the-labeled-stochastic-block-model/bibtex,Se-Young Yun; Alexandre Proutiere

Our network;  using only  a simple local-information based sensor implementing the cardioid angular gain function; operates at biological  spike rate of  10 Hz.  The network  tracks large angular targets (60 degrees) within 1 sec with a 10%  RMS error. We study the navigational ability of our model for foraging and target localization tasks in  a forest of obstacles  and show that our network requires less than 200X   spike-triggered decisions; while suffering only a 1% loss in performance compared to a  proportional-integral-derivative controller; in the presence of 50% additive noise. Superior performance can be obtained at  a higher average spike rate of  100 Hz  and  1000 Hz; but even the accelerated networks requires 20X and 10X lesser decisions respectively; demonstrating the superior computational efficiency of bio-inspired information processing systems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6558-efficient-and-robust-spiking-neural-circuit-for-navigation-inspired-by-echolocating-bats/bibtex,Pulkit Tandon; Yash H.

A composite estimator successively applies two (or more) estimators: on data decomposed into disjoint parts; it applies the first estimator on each part; then the second estimator on the outputs of the first estimator. And so on; if the composition is of more than two estimators. Informally; the breakdown point is the minimum fraction of data points which if significantly modified will also significantly modify the output of the estimator; so it is typically desirable to have a large breakdown point. Our main result shows that; under mild conditions on the individual estimators; the breakdown point of the composite estimator is the product of the breakdown points of the individual estimators. We also demonstrate several scenarios; ranging from regression to statistical testing; where this analysis is easy to apply; useful in understanding worst case robustness; and sheds powerful insights onto the associated data analysis.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6056-the-robustness-of-estimator-composition/bibtex,Pingfan Tang; Jeff M.

Recently proposed nonlinear factorization methods; although capable of capturing complex relationships; are computationally quite expensive and may suffer a severe learning bias in case of extreme data sparsity. Therefore; we propose a distributed; flexible nonlinear tensor factorization model; which avoids the expensive computations and structural restrictions of the Kronecker-product in the existing TGP formulations; allowing an arbitrary subset of tensor entries to be selected for training. Meanwhile; we derive a tractable and tight variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that enables highly decoupled; parallel computations and high-quality inference. Based on the new bound; we develop a distributed; key-value-free inference algorithm in the MapReduce framework; which can fully exploit the memory cache mechanism in fast MapReduce systems such as Spark.

In this paper; we consider a spectral analysis of the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We propose a modal decomposition algorithm to perform the analysis using finite-length data sequences generated from a nonlinear system. The algorithm is in essence reduced to the calculation of a set of orthogonal bases for the Krylov matrix in RKHS and the eigendecomposition of the projection of the Koopman operator onto the subspace spanned by the bases. The algorithm returns a decomposition of the dynamics into a finite number of modes; and thus it can be thought of as a feature extraction procedure for a nonlinear dynamical system. Therefore; we further consider applications in machine learning using extracted features with the presented analysis. We illustrate the method on the applications using synthetic and real-world data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6583-dynamic-mode-decomposition-with-reproducing-kernels-for-koopman-spectral-analysis/bibtex,Yoshinobu Kawahara

We leverage the natural synchronization between vision and sound to learn an acoustic representation using two-million unlabeled videos. Unlabeled video has the advantage that it can be economically acquired at massive scales; yet contains useful signals about natural sound. We propose a student-teacher training procedure which transfers discriminative visual knowledge from well established visual recognition models into the sound modality using unlabeled video as a bridge. Our sound representation yields significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks for acoustic scene/object classification. Visualizations suggest some high-level semantics automatically emerge in the sound network; even though it is trained without ground truth labels.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6146-soundnet-learning-sound-representations-from-unlabeled-video/bibtex,Yusuf Aytar; Carl Vondrick; Antonio Torralba

In that context; the optimal solution strategy for Bayesian optimization can be formulated as a dynamic programming instance. This results in a complex problem with uncountable; dimension-increasing state space and an uncountable control space. We show how to approximate the solution of this dynamic programming problem  using rollout; and propose rollout heuristics specifically designed for the Bayesian optimization setting. We present numerical experiments showing that the resulting algorithm for optimization with a finite budget outperforms several popular Bayesian optimization algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6188-bayesian-optimization-with-a-finite-budget-an-approximate-dynamic-programming-approach/bibtex,Remi Lam; Karen Willcox; David H.

We give prediction error guarantees that depend on the noisy-margin properties of the input sample; and are competitive with those obtained by previously proposed passive learners.

By reparameterizing the weights in this way we improve the conditioning of the optimization problem and we speed up convergence of stochastic gradient descent. Our reparameterization is inspired by batch normalization but does not introduce any dependencies between the examples in a minibatch. This means that our method can also be applied successfully to recurrent models such as LSTMs and to noise-sensitive applications such as deep reinforcement learning or generative models; for which batch normalization is less well suited. Although our method is much simpler; it still provides much of the speed-up of full batch normalization. In addition; the computational overhead of our method is lower; permitting more optimization steps to be taken in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on applications in supervised image recognition; generative modelling; and deep reinforcement learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6114-weight-normalization-a-simple-reparameterization-to-accelerate-training-of-deep-neural-networks/bibtex,Tim Salimans; Diederik P.

2016,Faster Projection-free Convex Optimization over the Spectrahedron,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6397-faster-projection-free-convex-optimization-over-the-spectrahedron.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6397-faster-projection-free-convex-optimization-over-the-spectrahedron,Minimizing a convex function over the spectrahedron; i.e.; the set of all $d\times d$ positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace; is an important optimization task with many applications in optimization; machine learning; and signal processing. It is also notoriously difficult to solve in large-scale since standard techniques require to compute expensive matrix decompositions. An alternative; is the conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) that regained much interest in recent years; mostly due to its application to this specific setting. The key benefit of the CG method is that it avoids expensive matrix decompositions all together; and simply requires a single eigenvector computation per iteration; which is much more efficient. On the downside; the CG method; in general; converges with an inferior rate. The error for minimizing a $\beta$-smooth function after $t$ iterations scales like $\beta/t$. This rate does not improve even if the function is also strongly convex. In this work we present a modification of the CG method tailored for the spectrahedron. The per-iteration complexity of the method is essentially identical to that of the standard CG method: only a single eigenvecor computation is required. For minimizing an $\alpha$-strongly convex and $\beta$-smooth function; the \textit{expected} error of the method after $t$ iterations is: $O\left({\min\{\frac{\beta{}}{t} ;\left({\frac{\beta\sqrt{\rank(\X^*)}}{\alpha^{1/4}t}}\right)^{4/3}; \left({\frac{\beta}{\sqrt{\alpha}\lambda_{\min}(\X^*)t}}\right)^{2}\}}\right)$. Beyond the significant improvement in convergence rate;  it also follows that when the optimum is low-rank; our method provides better accuracy-rank tradeoff than the standard CG method. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first result that attains provably faster convergence rates for a CG variant for optimization over the spectrahedron. We also present encouraging preliminary empirical results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6397-faster-projection-free-convex-optimization-over-the-spectrahedron/bibtex,Dan Garber; Dan Garber
2016,Temporal Regularized Matrix Factorization for High-dimensional Time Series Prediction,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6160-temporal-regularized-matrix-factorization-for-high-dimensional-time-series-prediction.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6160-temporal-regularized-matrix-factorization-for-high-dimensional-time-series-prediction,Time series prediction problems are becoming increasingly high-dimensional in modern applications; such as climatology and demand forecasting. For example; in the latter problem; the number of items for which demand needs to be forecast might be as large as 50;000. In addition; the data is generally noisy and full of missing values. Thus; modern applications require methods that are  highly scalable; and can deal with noisy data in terms of corruptions or missing values. However; classical time series methods usually fall short of handling these issues.  In this paper; we present a temporal regularized matrix factorization  (TRMF) framework which supports data-driven temporal learning and  forecasting. We develop novel regularization schemes and use scalable matrix factorization methods that are eminently suited for high-dimensional time series data that has many missing values.  Our proposed TRMF is highly general; and subsumes many existing approaches for time series analysis.  We make interesting connections to graph regularization methods in the context of learning the dependencies in an autoregressive framework. Experimental results show the superiority of TRMF in terms of scalability and prediction quality. In particular;  TRMF is two orders of magnitude  faster than other methods on a problem of dimension 50;000; and generates better forecasts on real-world datasets such as Wal-mart E-commerce datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6160-temporal-regularized-matrix-factorization-for-high-dimensional-time-series-prediction/bibtex,Hsiang-Fu Yu; Nikhil Rao; Inderjit S.

On the one hand; the annotation of position and transcript at line level is costly to obtain. On the other hand; automatic line segmentation algorithms are prone to errors; compromising the subsequent recognition.  In this paper; we propose a modification of the popular and efficient Multi-Dimensional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (MDLSTM-RNNs) to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. More particularly; we replace the collapse layer transforming the two-dimensional representation into a sequence of predictions by a recurrent version which can select one line at a time.  In the proposed model; a neural network performs a kind of implicit line segmentation by computing attention weights on the image representation. The experiments on paragraphs of Rimes and IAM databases yield results that are competitive with those of networks trained at line level; and constitute a significant step towards end-to-end transcription of full documents.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6257-joint-line-segmentation-and-transcription-for-end-to-end-handwritten-paragraph-recognition/bibtex,Theodore Bluche

Our objective is to use this simple setting to illustrate that strategies based on an exploration phase (up to a stopping time) followed by exploitation are necessarily suboptimal. The results hold regardless of whether or not the difference in means between the two arms is known. Besides the main message; we also refine existing deviation inequalities; which allow us to design fully sequential strategies with finite-time regret guarantees that are (a) asymptotically optimal as the horizon grows and (b) order-optimal in the minimax sense. Furthermore we provide empirical evidence that the theory also holds in practice and discuss extensions to non-gaussian and multiple-armed case.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6179-on-explore-then-commit-strategies/bibtex,Aurelien Garivier; Tor Lattimore; Emilie Kaufmann
2016,Dual Learning for Machine Translation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6469-dual-learning-for-machine-translation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6469-dual-learning-for-machine-translation,While neural machine translation (NMT) is making good progress in the past two years; tens of millions of bilingual sentence pairs are needed for its training. However; human labeling is very costly. To tackle this training data bottleneck; we develop a dual-learning mechanism; which can enable an NMT system to automatically learn from unlabeled data through a dual-learning game. This mechanism is inspired by the following observation: any machine translation task has a dual task; e.g.; English-to-French translation (primal) versus French-to-English translation (dual); the primal and dual tasks can form a closed loop; and generate informative feedback signals to train the translation models; even if without the involvement of a human labeler. In the dual-learning mechanism; we use one agent to represent the model for the primal task and the other agent to represent the model for the dual task; then ask them to teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. Based on the feedback signals generated during this process (e.g.; the language-model likelihood of the output of a model; and the reconstruction error of the original sentence after the primal and dual translations); we can iteratively update the two models until convergence (e.g.; using the policy gradient methods). We call the corresponding approach to neural machine translation \emph{dual-NMT}. Experiments show that dual-NMT works very well on English$\leftrightarrow$French translation; especially; by learning from monolingual data (with 10\% bilingual data for warm start); it achieves a comparable accuracy to NMT trained from the full bilingual data for the French-to-English translation task.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6469-dual-learning-for-machine-translation/bibtex,Di He; Yingce Xia; Tao Qin; Liwei Wang; Nenghai Yu; Tieyan Liu; Wei-Ying Ma

We focus on the most biased coin problem; asking how many total coin flips are required to identify a ``heavy'' coin from an infinite bag containing both ``heavy'' coins with mean $\theta_1 \in (0;1)$; and ``light" coins with mean $\theta_0 \in (0;\theta_1)$; where heavy coins are drawn from the bag with proportion $\alpha \in (0;1/2)$. When $\alpha;\theta_0;\theta_1$ are unknown; the key difficulty of this problem lies in distinguishing whether the two kinds of coins have very similar means; or whether heavy coins are just extremely rare. While existing solutions to this problem require some prior knowledge of the parameters $\theta_0;\theta_1;\alpha$; we propose an adaptive algorithm that requires no such knowledge yet still obtains near-optimal sample complexity guarantees. In contrast; we provide a lower bound showing that non-adaptive strategies require at least quadratically more samples.  In characterizing this gap between adaptive and nonadaptive strategies;  we make connections to anomaly detection and prove lower bounds on the sample complexity of differentiating between a single parametric distribution and a mixture of two such distributions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6072-the-power-of-adaptivity-in-identifying-statistical-alternatives/bibtex,Kevin G.

2016,Efficient Globally Convergent Stochastic Optimization for Canonical Correlation Analysis,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6459-efficient-globally-convergent-stochastic-optimization-for-canonical-correlation-analysis.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6459-efficient-globally-convergent-stochastic-optimization-for-canonical-correlation-analysis,We study the stochastic optimization of canonical correlation analysis (CCA); whose objective is nonconvex and does not decouple over training samples. Although several stochastic gradient based optimization algorithms have been recently proposed to solve this problem; no global convergence guarantee was provided by any of them. Inspired by the alternating least squares/power iterations formulation of CCA; and the shift-and-invert preconditioning method for PCA; we propose two globally convergent meta-algorithms for CCA; both of which transform the original problem into sequences of least squares problems that need only be solved approximately. We instantiate the meta-algorithms with state-of-the-art SGD methods and obtain time complexities that significantly improve upon that of previous work. Experimental results demonstrate their superior performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6459-efficient-globally-convergent-stochastic-optimization-for-canonical-correlation-analysis/bibtex,Weiran Wang; Jialei Wang; Dan Garber; Dan Garber; Nati Srebro
2016,Dialog-based Language Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6264-dialog-based-language-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6264-dialog-based-language-learning,A long-term goal of machine learning research is to build an intelligent dialog agent. Most research in natural language understanding has focused on learning from fixed training sets of labeled data; with supervision either at the word level (tagging; parsing tasks) or sentence level (question answering; machine translation). This kind of supervision is not realistic of how humans learn; where language is both learned by; and used for; communication. In this work; we study dialog-based language learning; where supervision is given naturally and implicitly in the response of the dialog partner during the conversation. We study this setup in two domains: the bAbI dataset of (Weston et al.; 2015) and large-scale question answering from (Dodge et al.; 2015). We evaluate a set of baseline learning strategies on these tasks; and show that a novel model incorporating predictive lookahead is a promising approach for learning from a teacher's response. In particular; a surprising result is that it can learn to answer questions correctly without any reward-based supervision at all.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6264-dialog-based-language-learning/bibtex,Jason E.

2016,Sublinear Time Orthogonal Tensor Decomposition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6496-sublinear-time-orthogonal-tensor-decomposition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6496-sublinear-time-orthogonal-tensor-decomposition,A recent work (Wang et. al.; NIPS 2015) gives the fastest known algorithms for orthogonal tensor decomposition with provable guarantees. Their algorithm is based on computing sketches of the input tensor; which requires reading the entire input. We show in a number of cases one can achieve the same theoretical guarantees in sublinear time; i.e.; even without reading most of the input tensor. Instead of using sketches to estimate inner products in tensor decomposition algorithms; we use importance sampling. To achieve sublinear time; we need to know the norms of tensor slices; and we show how to do this in a number of important cases. For symmetric tensors $ T = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i u_i^{\otimes p}$ with $\lambda_i > 0$ for all i; we estimate such norms in sublinear time whenever p is even. For the important case of p = 3 and small values of k; we can also estimate such norms. For asymmetric tensors sublinear time is not possible in general; but we show if the tensor slice norms are just slightly below $\| T \|_F$ then sublinear time is again possible. One of the main strengths of our work is empirical - in a number of cases our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods with the same accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6496-sublinear-time-orthogonal-tensor-decomposition/bibtex,Zhao Song; David Woodruff; Huan Zhang
2016,Deep Alternative Neural Network: Exploring Contexts as Early as Possible for Action Recognition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6335-deep-alternative-neural-network-exploring-contexts-as-early-as-possible-for-action-recognition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6335-deep-alternative-neural-network-exploring-contexts-as-early-as-possible-for-action-recognition,Contexts are crucial for action recognition in video. Current methods often mine contexts after extracting hierarchical local features and focus on their high-order encodings. This paper instead explores contexts as early as possible and leverages their evolutions for action recognition. In particular; we introduce a novel architecture called deep alternative neural network (DANN) stacking alternative layers. Each alternative layer consists of a volumetric convolutional layer followed by a recurrent layer. The former acts as local feature learner while the latter is used to collect contexts. Compared with feed-forward neural networks; DANN learns contexts of local features from the very beginning. This setting helps to preserve hierarchical context evolutions which we show are essential to recognize similar actions. Besides; we present an adaptive method to determine the temporal size for network input based on optical flow energy; and develop a volumetric pyramid pooling layer to deal with input clips of arbitrary sizes. We demonstrate the advantages of DANN on two benchmarks HMDB51 and UCF101 and report competitive or superior results to the state-of-the-art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6335-deep-alternative-neural-network-exploring-contexts-as-early-as-possible-for-action-recognition/bibtex,Jinzhuo Wang; Wenmin Wang; xiongtao Chen; Ronggang Wang; Wen Gao
2016,DECOrrelated feature space partitioning for distributed sparse regression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6349-decorrelated-feature-space-partitioning-for-distributed-sparse-regression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6349-decorrelated-feature-space-partitioning-for-distributed-sparse-regression,Fitting statistical models is computationally challenging when the sample size or the dimension of the dataset is huge. An attractive approach for down-scaling the problem size is to first partition the dataset into subsets and then fit using distributed algorithms. The dataset can be partitioned either horizontally (in the sample space) or vertically (in the feature space). While the majority of the literature focuses on sample space partitioning; feature space partitioning is more effective when p >> n. Existing methods for partitioning features; however; are either vulnerable to high correlations or inefficient in reducing the model dimension. In this paper; we solve these problems through a new embarrassingly parallel framework named DECO for distributed variable selection and parameter estimation. In DECO; variables are first partitioned and allocated to m distributed workers. The decorrelated subset data within each worker are then fitted via any algorithm designed for high-dimensional problems. We show that by incorporating the decorrelation step; DECO can achieve consistent variable selection and parameter estimation on each subset with (almost) no assumptions. In addition; the convergence rate is nearly minimax optimal for both sparse and weakly sparse models and does NOT depend on the partition number m. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of the new framework.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6349-decorrelated-feature-space-partitioning-for-distributed-sparse-regression/bibtex,Xiangyu Wang; David B.

We prove a lower bound showing an exponential separation between the regret of existing algorithms that require a known bound on the loss functions and any algorithm that does not require such knowledge. RescaledExp matches this lower bound asymptotically in the number of iterations. RescaledExp is naturally hyperparameter-free and we demonstrate empirically that it matches prior optimization algorithms that require hyperparameter optimization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6371-online-convex-optimization-with-unconstrained-domains-and-losses/bibtex,Ashok Cutkosky; Kwabena A.

2016,An ensemble diversity approach to supervised binary hashing,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6289-an-ensemble-diversity-approach-to-supervised-binary-hashing.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6289-an-ensemble-diversity-approach-to-supervised-binary-hashing,Binary hashing is a well-known approach for fast approximate nearest-neighbor search in information retrieval. Much work has focused on affinity-based objective functions involving the hash functions or binary codes. These objective functions encode neighborhood information between data points and are often inspired by manifold learning algorithms. They ensure that the hash functions differ from each other through constraints or penalty terms that encourage codes to be orthogonal or dissimilar across bits; but this couples the binary variables and complicates the already difficult optimization. We propose a much simpler approach: we train each hash function (or bit) independently from each other; but introduce diversity among them using techniques from classifier ensembles. Surprisingly; we find that not only is this faster and trivially parallelizable; but it also improves over the more complex; coupled objective function; and achieves state-of-the-art precision and recall in experiments with image retrieval.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6289-an-ensemble-diversity-approach-to-supervised-binary-hashing/bibtex,Miguel A.

In the application of learning to rank; we provide a hierarchy of rank-breaking mechanisms ordered by the complexity in thus generated sketch of the data. This allows the number of data points collected to be gracefully traded off against computational resources available; while guaranteeing the desired level of accuracy. Theoretical guarantees on the proposed generalized rank-breaking implicitly provide such trade-offs; which can be explicitly characterized under certain canonical scenarios on the structure of the data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6442-computational-and-statistical-tradeoffs-in-learning-to-rank/bibtex,Ashish Khetan; Sewoong Oh

We introduce a new dataset ?Depth in the Wild? consisting of images in the wild annotated with relative depth between pairs of random points. We also propose a new algorithm that learns to estimate metric depth using annotations of relative depth. Compared to the state of the art; our algorithm is simpler and performs better. Experiments show that our algorithm; combined with existing RGB-D data and our new relative depth annotations; significantly improves single-image depth perception in the wild.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6489-single-image-depth-perception-in-the-wild/bibtex,Weifeng Chen; Zhao Fu; Dawei Yang; Jia Deng
2016,SPALS: Fast Alternating Least Squares via Implicit Leverage Scores Sampling,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6436-spals-fast-alternating-least-squares-via-implicit-leverage-scores-sampling.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6436-spals-fast-alternating-least-squares-via-implicit-leverage-scores-sampling,Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is a powerful but computationally challenging tool in modern data analytics. In this paper; we show ways of sampling intermediate steps of alternating minimization algorithms for computing low rank tensor CP decompositions; leading to the sparse alternating least squares (SPALS) method. Specifically; we sample the the Khatri-Rao product; which arises as an intermediate object during the iterations of alternating least squares. This product captures the interactions between different tensor modes; and form the main computational bottleneck for solving many tensor related tasks. By exploiting the spectral structures of the matrix Khatri-Rao product; we provide efficient access to its statistical leverage scores. When applied to the tensor CP decomposition; our method leads to the first algorithm that runs in sublinear time per-iteration and approximates the output of deterministic alternating least squares algorithms. Empirical evaluations of this approach show significantly speedups over existing randomized and deterministic routines for performing CP decomposition. On a tensor of the size 2.4m by 6.6m by 92k with over 2 billion nonzeros formed by Amazon product reviews; our routine converges in two minutes to the same error as deterministic ALS.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6436-spals-fast-alternating-least-squares-via-implicit-leverage-scores-sampling/bibtex,Dehua Cheng; Richard Peng; Yan Liu; Ioakeim Perros

Our scheme computes estimates of the optimum from a nonlinear average of the iterates produced by any optimization method. The weights in this average are computed via a simple and small linear system; whose solution can be updated online. This acceleration scheme runs in parallel to the base algorithm; providing improved estimates of the solution on the fly; while the original optimization method is running.

2016,On Graph Reconstruction via Empirical Risk Minimization: Fast Learning Rates and Scalability,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6588-on-graph-reconstruction-via-empirical-risk-minimization-fast-learning-rates-and-scalability.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6588-on-graph-reconstruction-via-empirical-risk-minimization-fast-learning-rates-and-scalability,The problem of predicting connections between a set of data points finds many applications; in systems biology and social network analysis among others. This paper focuses on the \textit{graph reconstruction} problem; where the prediction rule is obtained by minimizing the average error over all n(n-1)/2 possible pairs of the n nodes of a training graph. Our first contribution is to derive learning rates of order O(log n / n) for this problem; significantly improving upon the slow rates of order O(1/?n) established in the seminal work of Biau & Bleakley (2006). Strikingly; these fast rates are universal; in contrast to similar results known for other statistical learning problems (e.g.; classification; density level set estimation; ranking; clustering) which require strong assumptions on the distribution of the data. Motivated by applications to large graphs; our second contribution deals with the computational complexity of graph reconstruction. Specifically; we investigate to which extent the learning rates can be preserved when replacing the empirical reconstruction risk by a computationally cheaper Monte-Carlo version; obtained by sampling with replacement B << n? pairs of nodes. Finally; we illustrate our theoretical results by numerical experiments on synthetic and real graphs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6588-on-graph-reconstruction-via-empirical-risk-minimization-fast-learning-rates-and-scalability/bibtex,Guillaume Papa; Aur?lien Bellet; Stephan Cl?men?on
2016,Barzilai-Borwein Step Size for Stochastic Gradient Descent,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6286-barzilai-borwein-step-size-for-stochastic-gradient-descent.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6286-barzilai-borwein-step-size-for-stochastic-gradient-descent,One of the major issues in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods is how to choose an appropriate step size while running the algorithm. Since the traditional line search technique does not apply for stochastic optimization methods; the common practice in SGD is either to use a diminishing step size; or to tune a step size by hand; which can be time consuming in practice. In this paper; we propose to use the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method to automatically compute step sizes for SGD and its variant: stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) method; which leads to two algorithms: SGD-BB and SVRG-BB. We prove that SVRG-BB converges linearly for strongly convex objective functions. As a by-product; we prove the linear convergence result of SVRG with Option I proposed in [10]; whose convergence result has been missing in the literature. Numerical experiments on standard data sets show that the performance of SGD-BB and SVRG-BB is comparable to and sometimes even better than SGD and SVRG with best-tuned step sizes; and is superior to some advanced SGD variants.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6286-barzilai-borwein-step-size-for-stochastic-gradient-descent/bibtex,Conghui Tan; Shiqian Ma; Yu-Hong Dai; Yuqiu Qian

Instead of computing distances in the image space; we compute distances between image features extracted by deep neural networks. This metric reflects perceptual similarity of images much better and; thus; leads to better results. We demonstrate two examples of use cases of the proposed loss: (1) networks that invert the AlexNet convolutional network; (2) a modified version of a variational autoencoder that generates realistic high-resolution random images.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6158-generating-images-with-perceptual-similarity-metrics-based-on-deep-networks/bibtex,Alexey Dosovitskiy; Thomas Brox
2016,Dynamic Filter Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6578-dynamic-filter-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6578-dynamic-filter-networks,In a traditional convolutional layer; the learned filters stay fixed after training. In contrast; we introduce a new framework; the Dynamic Filter Network; where filters are generated dynamically conditioned on an input. We show that this architecture is a powerful one; with increased flexibility thanks to its adaptive nature; yet without an excessive increase in the number of model parameters. A wide variety of filtering operation can be learned this way; including local spatial transformations; but also others like selective (de)blurring or adaptive feature extraction. Moreover; multiple such layers can be combined; e.g. in a recurrent architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic filter network on the tasks of video and stereo prediction; and reach state-of-the-art performance on the moving MNIST dataset with a much smaller model. By visualizing the learned filters; we illustrate that the network has picked up flow information by only looking at unlabelled training data. This suggests that the network can be used to pretrain networks for various supervised tasks in an unsupervised way; like optical flow and depth estimation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6578-dynamic-filter-networks/bibtex,Xu Jia; Bert De Brabandere; Tinne Tuytelaars; Luc V.

Our method achieves an accelerated convergence rate on strongly convex smooth problems. Our method has only one parameter (a step size); and is radically simpler than other accelerated methods for finite sums. Additionally it can be applied when the terms are non-smooth; yielding a method applicable in many areas where operator splitting methods would traditionally be applied.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6154-a-simple-practical-accelerated-method-for-finite-sums/bibtex,Aaron Defazio
2016,Optimizing affinity-based binary hashing using auxiliary coordinates,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6281-optimizing-affinity-based-binary-hashing-using-auxiliary-coordinates.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6281-optimizing-affinity-based-binary-hashing-using-auxiliary-coordinates,In supervised binary hashing; one wants to learn a function that maps a high-dimensional feature vector to a vector of binary codes; for application to fast image retrieval. This typically results in a difficult optimization problem; nonconvex and nonsmooth; because of the discrete variables involved. Much work has simply relaxed the problem during training; solving a continuous optimization; and truncating the codes a posteriori. This gives reasonable results but is quite suboptimal. Recent work has tried to optimize the objective directly over the binary codes and achieved better results; but the hash function was still learned a posteriori; which remains suboptimal. We propose a general framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based loss functions that uses auxiliary coordinates. This closes the loop and optimizes jointly over the hash functions and the binary codes so that they gradually match each other. The resulting algorithm can be seen as an iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then learning the hash function. Compared to this; our optimization is guaranteed to obtain better hash functions while being not much slower; as demonstrated experimentally in various supervised datasets. In addition; our framework facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6281-optimizing-affinity-based-binary-hashing-using-auxiliary-coordinates/bibtex,Ramin Raziperchikolaei; Miguel A.

2016,Double Thompson Sampling for Dueling Bandits,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6157-double-thompson-sampling-for-dueling-bandits.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6157-double-thompson-sampling-for-dueling-bandits,In this paper; we propose a Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS) algorithm for dueling bandit problems. As its name suggests; D-TS selects both the first and the second candidates according to Thompson Sampling. Specifically; D-TS maintains a posterior distribution for the preference matrix; and chooses the pair of arms for comparison according to two sets of samples independently drawn from the posterior distribution. This simple algorithm applies to general Copeland dueling bandits; including Condorcet dueling bandits as its special case.  For general Copeland dueling bandits; we show that D-TS achieves $O(K^2 \log T)$ regret. Moreover; using a back substitution argument; we refine the regret to $O(K \log T + K^2 \log \log T)$ in Condorcet dueling bandits and many practical Copeland dueling bandits. In addition; we propose an enhancement of D-TS; referred to as D-TS+; that reduces the regret by carefully breaking ties. Experiments based on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that D-TS and D-TS$^+$ significantly improve the overall performance; in terms of regret and robustness.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6157-double-thompson-sampling-for-dueling-bandits/bibtex,Huasen Wu; Xin Liu

Could we do deep visualization using untrained; random weight networks? To address this issue; we explore new and powerful generative models for three popular deep visualization tasks using untrained; random weight convolutional neural networks. First we invert representations in feature spaces and reconstruct images from white noise inputs. The reconstruction quality is statistically higher than that of the same method applied on well trained networks with the same architecture. Next we synthesize textures using scaled correlations of representations in multiple layers and our results are almost indistinguishable with the original natural texture and the synthesized textures based on the trained network. Third; by recasting the content of an image in the style of various artworks; we create artistic images with high perceptual quality; highly competitive to the prior work of Gatys et al. on pretrained networks. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of image representations using untrained deep neural networks. Our work provides a new and fascinating tool to study the representation of deep network architecture and sheds light on new understandings on deep visualization. It may possibly lead to a way to compare network architectures without training.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6568-a-powerful-generative-model-using-random-weights-for-the-deep-image-representation/bibtex,Kun He; Yan Wang; John Hopcroft

In this paper; we show how to create procedural models which learn how to satisfy constraints. We augment procedural models with neural networks which control how the model makes random choices based on the output it has generated thus far. We call such models neurally-guided procedural models. As a pre-computation; we train these models to maximize the likelihood of example outputs generated via SMC. They are then used as efficient SMC importance samplers; generating high-quality results with very few samples. We evaluate our method on L-system-like models with image-based constraints. Given a desired quality threshold; neurally-guided models can generate satisfactory results up to 10x faster than unguided models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6353-neurally-guided-procedural-models-amortized-inference-for-procedural-graphics-programs-using-neural-networks/bibtex,Daniel Ritchie; Anna Thomas; Pat Hanrahan; Noah Goodman

We propose a generative adversarial network for video with a spatio-temporal convolutional architecture that untangles the scene's foreground from the background. Experiments suggest this model can generate tiny videos up to a second at full frame rate better than simple baselines; and we show its utility at predicting plausible futures of static images. Moreover; experiments and visualizations show the model internally learns useful features for recognizing actions with minimal supervision; suggesting scene dynamics are a promising signal for representation learning. We believe generative video models can impact many applications in video understanding and simulation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6194-generating-videos-with-scene-dynamics/bibtex,Carl Vondrick; Hamed Pirsiavash; Antonio Torralba

These algorithms achieve optimal regret bounds that depend on the unknown competitors; without having to tune the learning rates with oracle choices.  We present a new intuitive framework to design parameter-free algorithms for both online linear optimization over Hilbert spaces and for learning with expert advice; based on reductions to betting on outcomes of adversarial coins. We instantiate it using a betting algorithm based on the Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator.  The resulting algorithms are simple; with no parameters to be tuned; and they improve or match previous results in terms of regret guarantee and per-round complexity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6159-coin-betting-and-parameter-free-online-learning/bibtex,Francesco Orabona; David Pal
2016,Testing for Differences in Gaussian Graphical Models:  Applications to Brain Connectivity,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6531-testing-for-differences-in-gaussian-graphical-models-applications-to-brain-connectivity.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6531-testing-for-differences-in-gaussian-graphical-models-applications-to-brain-connectivity,Functional brain networks are well described and estimated from data with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs); e.g.\ using sparse inverse covariance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two populations calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify differences in GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the uncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a parametric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-sample settings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse models is inherently challenging as the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work invokes the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso.  These distributions can be used to give confidence intervals on edges in GGMs; and by extension their differences. However; in the case of comparing GGMs; these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi-task fused lasso; whose distribution can be characterized in an efficient manner. We then show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in GGMs. We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6531-testing-for-differences-in-gaussian-graphical-models-applications-to-brain-connectivity/bibtex,Eugene Belilovsky; Ga?l Varoquaux; Matthew B.

2016,Deep Learning without Poor Local Minima,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6112-deep-learning-without-poor-local-minima.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6112-deep-learning-without-poor-local-minima,In this paper; we prove a conjecture published in 1989 and also partially address an open problem announced at the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) 2015. For an expected loss function of a deep nonlinear neural network; we prove the following statements under the independence assumption adopted from recent work: 1) the function is non-convex and non-concave; 2) every local minimum is a global minimum; 3) every critical point that is not a global minimum is a saddle point; and 4) the property of saddle points differs for shallow networks (with three layers) and deeper networks (with more than three layers). Moreover; we prove that the same four statements hold for deep linear neural networks with any depth; any widths and no unrealistic assumptions. As a result; we present an instance; for which we can answer to the following question: how difficult to directly train a deep model in theory? It is more difficult than the classical machine learning models (because of the non-convexity); but not too difficult (because of the nonexistence of poor local minima and the property of the saddle points). We note that even though we have advanced the theoretical foundations of deep learning; there is still a gap between theory and practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6112-deep-learning-without-poor-local-minima/bibtex,Kenji Kawaguchi
2016,A Constant-Factor Bi-Criteria Approximation Guarantee for k-means++,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6309-a-constant-factor-bi-criteria-approximation-guarantee-for-k-means.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6309-a-constant-factor-bi-criteria-approximation-guarantee-for-k-means,This paper studies the $k$-means++ algorithm for clustering as well as the class of $D^\ell$ sampling algorithms to which $k$-means++ belongs.  It is shown that for any constant factor $\beta > 1$; selecting $\beta k$ cluster centers by $D^\ell$ sampling yields a constant-factor approximation to the optimal clustering with $k$ centers; in expectation and without conditions on the dataset.  This result extends the previously known $O(\log k)$ guarantee for the case $\beta = 1$ to the constant-factor bi-criteria regime.  It also improves upon an existing constant-factor bi-criteria result that holds only with constant probability.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6309-a-constant-factor-bi-criteria-approximation-guarantee-for-k-means/bibtex,Dennis Wei
2016,Solving Random Systems of Quadratic Equations via Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6061-solving-random-systems-of-quadratic-equations-via-truncated-generalized-gradient-flow.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6061-solving-random-systems-of-quadratic-equations-via-truncated-generalized-gradient-flow,This paper puts forth a novel algorithm; termed \emph{truncated generalized gradient flow} (TGGF); to solve for $\bm{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{C}^n$ a system of $m$ quadratic equations $y_i=|\langle\bm{a}_i;\bm{x}\rangle|^2$; $i=1;2;\ldots;m$; which even for $\left\{\bm{a}_i\in\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{C}^n\right\}_{i=1}^m$ random is known to be \emph{NP-hard} in general. We prove that as soon as the number of equations $m$ is on the order of the number of unknowns $n$; TGGF recovers the solution exactly (up to a global unimodular constant) with high probability and complexity growing linearly with the time required to read the data $\left\{\left(\bm{a}_i;\;y_i\right)\right\}_{i=1}^m$. Specifically; TGGF proceeds in two stages: s1) A novel \emph{orthogonality-promoting} initialization that is obtained with simple power iterations; and; s2) a refinement of the initial estimate by successive updates of scalable \emph{truncated generalized gradient iterations}. The former is in sharp contrast to the existing spectral initializations; while the latter handles the rather challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth \emph{amplitude-based} cost function. Numerical tests demonstrate that: i) The novel orthogonality-promoting initialization method returns more accurate and robust estimates relative to its spectral counterparts; and ii) even with the same initialization; our refinement/truncation outperforms Wirtinger-based alternatives; all corroborating the superior performance of TGGF over state-of-the-art algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6061-solving-random-systems-of-quadratic-equations-via-truncated-generalized-gradient-flow/bibtex,Gang Wang; Georgios Giannakis
2016,Adversarial Multiclass Classification: A Risk Minimization Perspective,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6088-adversarial-multiclass-classification-a-risk-minimization-perspective.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6088-adversarial-multiclass-classification-a-risk-minimization-perspective,Recently proposed adversarial classification methods have shown promising results for cost sensitive and multivariate losses. In contrast with empirical risk minimization (ERM) methods; which use convex surrogate losses to approximate the desired non-convex target loss function; adversarial methods minimize non-convex losses by treating the properties of the training data as being uncertain and worst case within a minimax game. Despite this difference in formulation; we recast adversarial classification under zero-one loss as an ERM method with a novel prescribed loss function. We demonstrate a number of theoretical and practical advantages over the very closely related hinge loss ERM methods. This establishes adversarial classification under the zero-one loss as a method that fills the long standing gap in multiclass hinge loss classification; simultaneously guaranteeing Fisher consistency and universal consistency; while also providing dual parameter sparsity and high accuracy predictions in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6088-adversarial-multiclass-classification-a-risk-minimization-perspective/bibtex,Rizal Fathony; Anqi Liu; Kaiser Asif; Brian Ziebart
2016,Residual Networks Behave Like Ensembles of Relatively Shallow Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6556-residual-networks-behave-like-ensembles-of-relatively-shallow-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6556-residual-networks-behave-like-ensembles-of-relatively-shallow-networks,In this work we propose a novel interpretation of residual networks showing that they can be seen as a collection of many paths of differing length. Moreover; residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the short paths during training. To support this observation; we rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional models; paths through residual networks vary in length. Further; a lesion study reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally; and most surprising; most paths are shorter than one might expect; and only the short paths are needed during training; as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example; most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient throughout the extent of very deep networks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6556-residual-networks-behave-like-ensembles-of-relatively-shallow-networks/bibtex,Andreas Veit; Michael J.

2016,Robust Spectral Detection of Global Structures in the Data by Learning a Regularization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6491-robust-spectral-detection-of-global-structures-in-the-data-by-learning-a-regularization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6491-robust-spectral-detection-of-global-structures-in-the-data-by-learning-a-regularization,Spectral methods are popular in detecting global structures in the given data that can be represented as a matrix. However when the data matrix is sparse or noisy; classic spectral methods usually fail to work; due to localization of eigenvectors (or singular vectors) induced by the sparsity or noise. In this work; we propose a general method to solve the localization problem by learning a regularization matrix from the localized eigenvectors. Using matrix perturbation analysis; we demonstrate that the learned  regularizations suppress down the eigenvalues associated with localized  eigenvectors and enable us to recover the informative eigenvectors representing the global structure. We show applications of our method in several inference problems: community detection in networks; clustering from pairwise similarities; rank estimation and matrix completion problems. Using extensive experiments; we illustrate that our method solves the localization problem and works down to the  theoretical detectability limits in different kinds of synthetic data. This is in contrast with existing spectral algorithms based on data matrix; non-backtracking matrix; Laplacians and those with rank-one regularizations; which perform poorly in the sparse case with noise.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6491-robust-spectral-detection-of-global-structures-in-the-data-by-learning-a-regularization/bibtex,Pan Zhang
2016,Operator Variational Inference,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6091-operator-variational-inference.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6091-operator-variational-inference,Variational inference is an umbrella term for algorithms which cast Bayesian inference as optimization. Classically; variational inference uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence to define the optimization. Though this divergence has been widely used; the resultant posterior approximation can suffer from undesirable statistical properties. To address this; we reexamine variational inference from its roots as an optimization problem. We use operators; or functions of functions; to design variational objectives. As one example; we design a variational objective with a Langevin-Stein operator. We develop a black box algorithm; operator variational inference (OPVI); for optimizing any operator objective. Importantly; operators enable us to make explicit the statistical and computational tradeoffs for variational inference. We can characterize different properties of variational objectives; such as objectives that admit data subsampling---allowing inference to scale to massive data---as well as objectives that admit variational programs---a rich class of posterior approximations that does not require a tractable density. We illustrate the benefits of OPVI on a mixture model and a generative model of images.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6091-operator-variational-inference/bibtex,Rajesh Ranganath; Dustin Tran; Jaan Altosaar; David Blei

However; traditional side information is mostly at the instance level and subject to the sampling bias; where non-randomly sampled instances in the supervision can mislead the algorithms to wrong clusters. In this paper; we propose learning from the feature-level supervision. We show that this kind of supervision can be easily obtained in the form of perception vectors in many applications. Then we present novel algorithms; called Perception Embedded (PE) clustering; that exploit the perception vectors as well as traditional side information to find clusters perceived by the user. Extensive experiments are conducted on real datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of PE empirically.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6260-learning-user-perceived-clusters-with-feature-level-supervision/bibtex,Ting-Yu Cheng; Guiguan Lin; xinyang gong; Kang-Jun Liu; Shan-Hung Wu
2016,Variational Information Maximization for Feature Selection,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6444-variational-information-maximization-for-feature-selection.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6444-variational-information-maximization-for-feature-selection,Feature selection is one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning. An extensive body of work on information-theoretic feature selection exists which is based on maximizing mutual information between subsets of features and class labels. Practical methods are forced to rely on approximations due to the difficulty of estimating mutual information. We demonstrate that approximations made by existing methods are based on unrealistic assumptions. We formulate a more flexible and general class of assumptions based on variational distributions and use them to tractably generate lower bounds for mutual information. These bounds define a novel information-theoretic framework for feature selection; which we prove to be optimal under tree graphical models with proper choice of variational distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method strongly outperforms existing information-theoretic feature selection approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6444-variational-information-maximization-for-feature-selection/bibtex,Shuyang Gao; Greg Ver Steeg; Aram Galstyan

Discriminative methods based on deep learning; which are very effective in other learning scenarios; are ill-suited for one-shot learning as they need large amounts of training data. In this paper; we propose a method to learn the parameters of a deep model in one shot. We construct the learner as a second deep network; called a learnet; which predicts the parameters of a pupil network from a single exemplar. In this manner we obtain an efficient feed-forward one-shot learner; trained end-to-end by minimizing a one-shot classification objective in a learning to learn formulation. In order to make the construction feasible; we propose a number of factorizations of the parameters of the pupil network. We demonstrate encouraging results by learning characters from single exemplars in Omniglot; and by tracking visual objects from a single initial exemplar in the Visual Object Tracking benchmark.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6068-learning-feed-forward-one-shot-learners/bibtex,Luca Bertinetto; Jo?o F.

2016,The Generalized Reparameterization Gradient,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6328-the-generalized-reparameterization-gradient.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6328-the-generalized-reparameterization-gradient,The reparameterization gradient has become a widely used method to obtain Monte Carlo gradients to optimize the variational objective. However; this technique does not easily apply to commonly used distributions such as beta or gamma without further approximations; and most practical applications of the reparameterization gradient fit Gaussian distributions. In this paper; we introduce the generalized reparameterization gradient; a method that extends the reparameterization gradient to a wider class of variational distributions. Generalized reparameterizations use invertible transformations of the latent variables which lead to transformed distributions that weakly depend on the variational parameters. This results in new Monte Carlo gradients that combine reparameterization gradients and score function gradients. We demonstrate our approach on variational inference for two complex probabilistic models. The generalized reparameterization is effective: even a single sample from the variational distribution is enough to obtain a low-variance gradient.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6328-the-generalized-reparameterization-gradient/bibtex,Francisco R.

2016,Stochastic Online AUC Maximization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6065-stochastic-online-auc-maximization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6065-stochastic-online-auc-maximization,Area under ROC (AUC) is a metric which is widely used for measuring the classification performance for imbalanced data. It is of theoretical and practical interest to develop online learning algorithms that maximizes AUC for large-scale data. A specific challenge in developing online AUC maximization algorithm is that the learning objective function is usually defined over a pair of training examples of opposite classes; and existing methods achieves on-line processing with higher space and time complexity. In this work; we propose a new stochastic online algorithm for AUC maximization. In particular; we show that AUC optimization can  be equivalently formulated as a convex-concave saddle point problem. From this saddle representation; a stochastic online algorithm (SOLAM) is proposed which has time and space complexity of one datum. We establish theoretical convergence of SOLAM with high probability and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency on standard benchmark datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6065-stochastic-online-auc-maximization/bibtex,Yiming Ying; Longyin Wen; Siwei Lyu

For pool-based active learning; several effective methods with theoretical guarantees have been developed through maximizing some utility function satisfying adaptive submodularity. In contrast; there have been few methods for stream-based active learning based on adaptive submodularity. In this paper; we propose a new class of utility functions; policy-adaptive submodular functions; and prove this class includes many existing adaptive submodular functions appearing in real world problems. We provide a general framework based on policy-adaptive submodularity that makes it possible to convert existing pool-based methods to stream-based methods and give theoretical guarantees on their performance. In addition we empirically demonstrate their effectiveness comparing with existing heuristics on common benchmark datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6038-budgeted-stream-based-active-learning-via-adaptive-submodular-maximization/bibtex,Kaito Fujii; Hisashi Kashima
2016,Fast learning rates with heavy-tailed losses,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6104-fast-learning-rates-with-heavy-tailed-losses.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6104-fast-learning-rates-with-heavy-tailed-losses,We study fast learning rates when the losses are not necessarily bounded and may have a distribution with heavy tails. To enable such analyses; we introduce two new conditions: (i)  the envelope function $\sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}}|\ell \circ f|$; where $\ell$ is the loss function and $\mathcal{F}$ is the hypothesis class; exists and is $L^r$-integrable; and (ii) $\ell$ satisfies the multi-scale Bernstein's condition on $\mathcal{F}$. Under these assumptions; we prove that learning rate faster than $O(n^{-1/2})$ can be obtained and; depending on $r$ and the multi-scale Bernstein's powers; can be arbitrarily close to $O(n^{-1})$. We then verify these assumptions and derive fast learning rates for the problem of vector quantization by $k$-means clustering with heavy-tailed distributions. The analyses enable us to obtain novel learning rates that extend and complement existing results in the literature from both theoretical and practical viewpoints.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6104-fast-learning-rates-with-heavy-tailed-losses/bibtex,Vu C.

2016,Exponential Family Embeddings,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6571-exponential-family-embeddings.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6571-exponential-family-embeddings,Word embeddings are a powerful approach to capturing semantic similarity among terms in a vocabulary. In this paper; we develop exponential family embeddings; which extends the idea of word embeddings to other types of high-dimensional data. As examples; we studied several types of data: neural data with real-valued observations; count data from a market basket analysis; and ratings data from a movie recommendation system. The main idea is that each observation is modeled conditioned on a set of latent embeddings and other observations; called the context; where the way the context is defined depends on the problem. In language the context is the surrounding words; in neuroscience the context is close-by neurons; in market basket data the context is other items in the shopping cart. Each instance of an embedding defines the context; the exponential family of conditional distributions; and how the embedding vectors are shared across data. We infer the embeddings with stochastic gradient descent; with an algorithm that connects closely to generalized linear models. On all three of our applications?neural activity of zebrafish; users? shopping behavior; and movie ratings?we found that exponential family embedding models are more effective than other dimension reduction methods. They better reconstruct held-out data and find interesting qualitative structure.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6571-exponential-family-embeddings/bibtex,Maja Rudolph; Francisco Ruiz; Stephan Mandt; David Blei
2016,Coupled Generative Adversarial Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6544-coupled-generative-adversarial-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6544-coupled-generative-adversarial-networks,We propose the coupled generative adversarial nets (CoGAN) framework for generating pairs of corresponding images in two different domains. The framework consists of a pair of generative adversarial nets; each responsible for generating images in one domain. We show that by enforcing a simple weight-sharing constraint; the CoGAN learns to generate pairs of corresponding images without existence of any pairs of corresponding images in the two domains in the training set. In other words; the CoGAN learns a joint distribution of images in the two domains from images drawn separately from the marginal distributions of the individual domains. This is in contrast to the existing multi-modal generative models; which require corresponding images for training. We apply the CoGAN to several pair image generation tasks. For each task; the CoGAN learns to generate convincing pairs of corresponding images. We further demonstrate the applications of the CoGAN framework for the domain adaptation and cross-domain image generation tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6544-coupled-generative-adversarial-networks/bibtex,Ming-Yu Liu; Oncel Tuzel

We prove that any complete and decomposable SPN is equivalent to a mixture of trees where each tree corresponds to a product of univariate distributions. Based on the mixture model perspective; we characterize the objective function when learning SPNs based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle and show that the optimization problem can be formulated as a signomial program. We construct two parameter learning algorithms for SPNs by using sequential monomial approximations (SMA) and the concave-convex procedure (CCCP); respectively. The two proposed methods naturally admit multiplicative updates; hence effectively avoiding the projection operation. With the help of the unified framework; we also show that; in the case of SPNs; CCCP leads to the same algorithm as Expectation Maximization (EM) despite the fact that they are different in general.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6423-a-unified-approach-for-learning-the-parameters-of-sum-product-networks/bibtex,Han Zhao; Pascal Poupart; Geoffrey J.

More specifically; we introduce a large-scale dataset with 300 million sentences describing over 40 million images crawled and downloaded from publicly available Pins (i.e. an image with sentence descriptions uploaded by users) on Pinterest. This dataset is more than 200 times larger than MS COCO; the standard large-scale image dataset with sentence descriptions. In addition; we construct an evaluation dataset to directly assess the effectiveness of word embeddings in terms of finding semantically similar or related words and phrases. The word/phrase pairs in this evaluation dataset are collected from the click data with millions of users in an image search system; thus contain rich semantic relationships. Based on these datasets; we propose and compare several Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) based multimodal (text and image) models. Experiments show that our model benefits from incorporating the visual information into the word embeddings; and a weight sharing strategy is crucial for learning such multimodal embeddings.

For probabilistic models in the Bayes optimal setting; a general expression for the mutual information has been proposed using heuristic statistical physics computations; and proven in few specific cases. Here; we show how to rigorously prove the conjectured formula for the symmetric rank-one case. This allows to express the minimal mean-square-error and to characterize the detectability phase transitions in a large set of estimation problems ranging from community detection to sparse PCA. We also show that for a large set of parameters; an iterative algorithm called approximate message-passing is Bayes optimal. There exists; however; a gap between what currently known polynomial algorithms can do and what is expected information theoretically. Additionally; the proof technique has an interest of its own and exploits three essential ingredients: the interpolation method introduced in statistical physics by Guerra; the analysis of the approximate message-passing algorithm and the theory of spatial coupling and threshold saturation in coding. Our approach is generic and applicable to other open problems in statistical estimation where heuristic statistical physics predictions are available.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6380-mutual-information-for-symmetric-rank-one-matrix-estimation-a-proof-of-the-replica-formula/bibtex,Jean Barbier; Mohamad Dia; Nicolas Macris; Florent Krzakala; Thibault Lesieur; Lenka Zdeborov?

In this context; can we learn a data-driven model of opinion dynamics that is able to accurately forecast users' opinions? In this paper; we introduce SLANT; a probabilistic modeling framework of opinion dynamics; which represents users' opinions over time by means of marked jump  diffusion stochastic differential equations; and allows for efficient model simulation and parameter estimation from historical fine grained event data. We then leverage our framework to derive a set of efficient predictive formulas for opinion forecasting and identify conditions under which opinions converge to a steady state. Experiments on data gathered from Twitter show that our model provides a good fit to the data and our formulas achieve more accurate forecasting than alternatives.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6193-learning-and-forecasting-opinion-dynamics-in-social-networks/bibtex,Abir De; Isabel Valera; Niloy Ganguly; Sourangshu Bhattacharya; Manuel Gomez Rodriguez
2016,Gradient-based Sampling: An Adaptive Importance Sampling for Least-squares,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6579-gradient-based-sampling-an-adaptive-importance-sampling-for-least-squares.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6579-gradient-based-sampling-an-adaptive-importance-sampling-for-least-squares,In modern data analysis; random sampling is an efficient and widely-used strategy to overcome the computational difficulties brought by large sample size. In previous studies; researchers conducted random sampling which is according to the input data but independent on the response variable; however the response variable may also be informative for sampling. In this paper we propose an adaptive sampling called the gradient-based sampling which is dependent on both the input data and the output for fast solving of least-square (LS) problems. We draw the data points by random sampling from the full data according to their gradient values. This sampling is computationally saving; since the running time of computing the sampling probabilities is reduced to O(nd) where n is the full sample size and d is the dimension of the input. Theoretically; we establish an error bound analysis of the general importance sampling with respect to LS solution from full data. The result establishes an improved performance of the use of our gradient-based sampling. Synthetic and real data sets are used to empirically argue that the gradient-based sampling has an obvious advantage over existing sampling methods from two aspects of statistical efficiency and computational saving.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6579-gradient-based-sampling-an-adaptive-importance-sampling-for-least-squares/bibtex,Rong Zhu
2016,R-FCN: Object Detection via Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6465-r-fcn-object-detection-via-region-based-fully-convolutional-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6465-r-fcn-object-detection-via-region-based-fully-convolutional-networks,We present region-based; fully convolutional networks for accurate and efficient object detection. In contrast to previous region-based detectors such as Fast/Faster R-CNN that apply a costly per-region subnetwork hundreds of times; our region-based detector is fully convolutional with almost all computation shared on the entire image. To achieve this goal; we propose position-sensitive score maps to address a dilemma between translation-invariance in image classification and translation-variance in object detection. Our method can thus naturally adopt fully convolutional image classifier backbones; such as the latest Residual Networks (ResNets); for object detection. We show competitive results on the PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g.; 83.6% mAP on the 2007 set) with the 101-layer ResNet. Meanwhile; our result is achieved at a test-time speed of 170ms per image; 2.5-20 times faster than the Faster R-CNN counterpart.

2016,GAP Safe Screening Rules for Sparse-Group Lasso,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6405-gap-safe-screening-rules-for-sparse-group-lasso.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6405-gap-safe-screening-rules-for-sparse-group-lasso,For statistical learning in high dimension; sparse regularizations have proven useful to boost both computational and statistical efficiency. In some contexts; it is natural to handle more refined structures than pure sparsity; such as for instance group sparsity. Sparse-Group Lasso has recently been introduced in the context of linear regression to enforce sparsity both at the feature and at the group level. We propose the first (provably) safe screening rules for Sparse-Group Lasso; i.e.; rules that allow to discard early in the solver features/groups that are inactive at optimal solution. Thanks to efficient dual gap computations relying on the geometric properties of $\epsilon$-norm; safe screening rules for Sparse-Group Lasso lead to significant gains in term of computing time for our coordinate descent implementation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6405-gap-safe-screening-rules-for-sparse-group-lasso/bibtex,Eugene Ndiaye; Olivier Fercoq; Alexandre Gramfort; Joseph Salmon
2016,Collaborative Recurrent Autoencoder: Recommend while Learning to Fill in the Blanks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6163-collaborative-recurrent-autoencoder-recommend-while-learning-to-fill-in-the-blanks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6163-collaborative-recurrent-autoencoder-recommend-while-learning-to-fill-in-the-blanks,Hybrid methods that utilize both content and rating information are commonly used in many recommender systems. However; most of them use either handcrafted features or the bag-of-words representation as a surrogate for the content information but they are neither effective nor natural enough. To address this problem; we develop a collaborative recurrent autoencoder (CRAE) which is a denoising recurrent autoencoder (DRAE) that models the generation of content sequences in the collaborative filtering (CF) setting. The model generalizes recent advances in recurrent deep learning from i.i.d. input to non-i.i.d. (CF-based) input and provides a new denoising scheme along with a novel learnable pooling scheme for the recurrent autoencoder. To do this; we first develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for the DRAE and then generalize it to the CF setting. The synergy between denoising and CF enables CRAE to make accurate recommendations while learning to fill in the blanks in sequences. Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains (CiteULike and Netflix) show that; by jointly modeling the order-aware generation of sequences for the content information and performing CF for the ratings; CRAE is able to significantly outperform the state of the art on both the recommendation task based on ratings and the sequence generation task based on content information.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6163-collaborative-recurrent-autoencoder-recommend-while-learning-to-fill-in-the-blanks/bibtex,Hao Wang; Xingjian SHI; Dit-Yan Yeung
2016,Multimodal Residual Learning for Visual QA,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6446-multimodal-residual-learning-for-visual-qa.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6446-multimodal-residual-learning-for-visual-qa,Deep neural networks continue to advance the state-of-the-art of image recognition tasks with various methods. However; applications of these methods to multimodality remain limited. We present Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN) for the multimodal residual learning of visual question-answering; which extends the idea of the deep residual learning. Unlike the deep residual learning; MRN effectively learns the joint representation from visual and language information. The main idea is to use element-wise multiplication for the joint residual mappings exploiting the residual learning of the attentional models in recent studies. Various alternative models introduced by multimodality are explored based on our study. We achieve the state-of-the-art results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks. Moreover; we introduce a novel method to visualize the attention effect of the joint representations for each learning block using back-propagation algorithm; even though the visual features are collapsed without spatial information.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6446-multimodal-residual-learning-for-visual-qa/bibtex,Jin-Hwa Kim; Sang-Woo Lee; Donghyun Kwak; Min-Oh Heo; Jeonghee Kim; Jung-Woo Ha; Byoung-Tak Zhang

DISCO Nets allow us to efficiently sample from a posterior distribution parametrised by a neural network. During training; DISCO Nets are learned by minimising the dissimilarity coefficient between the true distribution and the estimated distribution. This allows us to tailor the training to the loss related to the task at hand. We empirically show that (i) by modeling uncertainty on the output value; DISCO Nets outperform equivalent non-probabilistic predictive networks and (ii) DISCO Nets accurately model the uncertainty of the output; outperforming existing probabilistic models based on deep neural networks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6143-disco-nets-dissimilarity-coefficients-networks/bibtex,Diane Bouchacourt; Pawan K.

2016,Domain Separation Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6254-domain-separation-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6254-domain-separation-networks,The cost of large scale data collection and annotation often makes the application of machine learning algorithms to new tasks or datasets prohibitively expensive. One approach circumventing this cost is training models on synthetic data where annotations are provided automatically. Despite their appeal; such models often fail to generalize from synthetic to real images; necessitating domain adaptation algorithms to manipulate these models before they can be successfully applied. Existing approaches focus either on mapping representations from one domain to the other; or on learning to extract features that are invariant to the domain from which they were extracted. However; by focusing only on creating a mapping or shared representation between the two domains; they ignore the individual characteristics of each domain. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling what is unique to each domain can improve a model's ability to extract domain-invariant features. Inspired by work on private-shared component analysis; we explicitly learn to extract image representations that are partitioned into two subspaces: one component which is private to each domain and one which is shared across domains. Our model is trained to not only perform the task we care about in the source domain; but also to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the images from both domains. Our novel architecture results in a model that outperforms the state-of-the-art on a range of unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios and additionally produces  visualizations of the private and shared representations enabling interpretation of the domain adaptation process.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6254-domain-separation-networks/bibtex,Konstantinos Bousmalis; George Trigeorgis; Nathan Silberman; Dilip Krishnan; Dumitru Erhan
2016,CMA-ES with Optimal Covariance Update and Storage Complexity,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6457-cma-es-with-optimal-covariance-update-and-storage-complexity.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6457-cma-es-with-optimal-covariance-update-and-storage-complexity,The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is arguably one of the most powerful real-valued derivative-free optimization algorithms; finding many applications in machine learning. The CMA-ES is a Monte Carlo method; sampling from a sequence of multi-variate Gaussian distributions. Given the function values at the sampled points; updating and storing the covariance matrix dominates the time and space complexity in each iteration of the algorithm. We propose a numerically stable quadratic-time covariance matrix update scheme with minimal memory requirements based on maintaining triangular Cholesky factors. This requires a modification of the cumulative step-size adaption (CSA) mechanism in the CMA-ES; in which we replace the inverse of the square root of the covariance matrix by the inverse of the triangular Cholesky factor. Because the triangular Cholesky factor changes smoothly with the matrix square root; this modification does not change the behavior of the CMA-ES in terms of required objective function evaluations as verified empirically. Thus; the described algorithm can and should replace the standard CMA-ES if updating and storing the covariance matrix matters.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6457-cma-es-with-optimal-covariance-update-and-storage-complexity/bibtex,Oswin Krause; D?dac Rodr?guez Arbon?s; Christian Igel
2016,Joint M-Best-Diverse Labelings as a Parametric Submodular Minimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6396-joint-m-best-diverse-labelings-as-a-parametric-submodular-minimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6396-joint-m-best-diverse-labelings-as-a-parametric-submodular-minimization,We consider the problem of jointly inferring the $M$-best diverse labelings for a binary (high-order) submodular energy of a graphical model. Recently; it was shown that this problem can be solved to a global optimum; for many practically interesting diversity measures. It was noted that the labelings are; so-called; nested.  This nestedness property also holds for labelings of a class of parametric submodular minimization problems; where different values of the global parameter $\gamma$ give rise to different solutions. The popular example of the parametric submodular minimization is the monotonic parametric max-flow problem; which is also widely used for computing multiple labelings.  As the main contribution of this work we establish a close relationship between diversity with submodular energies and the parametric submodular minimization. In particular; the joint $M$-best diverse labelings can be obtained by running a non-parametric submodular minimization (in the special case - max-flow) solver for $M$ different values of $\gamma$ in parallel; for certain diversity measures. Importantly; the values for~$\gamma$ can be computed in a closed form in advance; prior to any optimization. These theoretical results suggest two simple yet efficient algorithms for the joint $M$-best diverse problem; which outperform competitors in terms of runtime and quality of results. In particular; as we show in the paper; the new methods compute the exact $M$-best diverse labelings faster than a popular method of Batra et al.; which in some sense only obtains approximate solutions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6396-joint-m-best-diverse-labelings-as-a-parametric-submodular-minimization/bibtex,Alexander Kirillov; Alexander Shekhovtsov; Carsten Rother; Bogdan Savchynskyy
2016,Fairness in Learning: Classic and Contextual Bandits,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6355-fairness-in-learning-classic-and-contextual-bandits.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6355-fairness-in-learning-classic-and-contextual-bandits,We introduce the study of fairness in multi-armed bandit problems. Our fairness definition demands that; given a pool of applicants; a worse applicant is never favored over a better one; despite a learning algorithm?s uncertainty over the true payoffs. In the classic stochastic bandits problem we provide a provably fair algorithm based on ?chained? confidence intervals; and prove a cumulative regret bound with a cubic dependence on the number of arms. We further show that any fair algorithm must have such a dependence; providing a strong separation between fair and unfair learning that extends to the general contextual case. In the general contextual case; we prove a tight connection between fairness and the KWIK (Knows What It Knows) learning model: a KWIK algorithm for a class of functions can be transformed into a provably fair contextual bandit algorithm and vice versa. This tight connection allows us to provide a provably fair algorithm for the linear contextual bandit problem with a polynomial dependence on the dimension; and to show (for a different class of functions) a worst-case exponential gap in regret between fair and non-fair learning algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6355-fairness-in-learning-classic-and-contextual-bandits/bibtex,Matthew Joseph; Michael Kearns; Jamie H.

2016,FPNN: Field Probing Neural Networks for 3D Data,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6416-fpnn-field-probing-neural-networks-for-3d-data.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6416-fpnn-field-probing-neural-networks-for-3d-data,Building discriminative representations for 3D data has been an important task in computer graphics and computer vision research. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown to operate on 2D images with great success for a variety of tasks. Lifting convolution operators to 3D (3DCNNs) seems like a plausible and promising next step. Unfortunately; the computational complexity of 3D CNNs grows cubically with respect to voxel resolution. Moreover; since most 3D geometry representations are boundary based; occupied regions do not increase proportionately with the size of the discretization; resulting in wasted computation. In this work; we represent 3D spaces as volumetric fields; and propose a novel design that employs field probing filters to efficiently extract features from them. Each field probing filter is a set of probing points -- sensors that perceive the space. Our learning algorithm optimizes not only the weights associated with the probing points; but also their locations; which deforms the shape of the probing filters and adaptively distributes them in 3D space. The optimized probing points sense the 3D space "intelligently"; rather than operating blindly over the entire domain. We show that field probing is significantly more efficient than 3DCNNs; while providing state-of-the-art performance; on classification tasks for 3D object recognition benchmark datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6416-fpnn-field-probing-neural-networks-for-3d-data/bibtex,Yangyan Li; Soeren Pirk; Hao Su; Charles R.

2016,f-GAN: Training Generative Neural Samplers using Variational Divergence Minimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6066-f-gan-training-generative-neural-samplers-using-variational-divergence-minimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6066-f-gan-training-generative-neural-samplers-using-variational-divergence-minimization,Generative neural networks are probabilistic models that implement sampling using feedforward neural networks: they take a random input vector and produce a sample from a probability distribution defined by the network weights. These models are expressive and allow efficient computation of samples and derivatives; but cannot be used for computing likelihoods or for marginalization. The generative-adversarial training method allows to train such models through the use of an auxiliary discriminative neural network. We show that the generative-adversarial approach is a special case of an existing more general variational divergence estimation approach. We show that any $f$-divergence can be used for training generative neural networks. We discuss the benefits of various choices of divergence functions on training complexity and the quality of the obtained generative models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6066-f-gan-training-generative-neural-samplers-using-variational-divergence-minimization/bibtex,Sebastian Nowozin; Botond Cseke; Ryota Tomioka
2016,Hierarchical Question-Image Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6202-hierarchical-question-image-co-attention-for-visual-question-answering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6202-hierarchical-question-image-co-attention-for-visual-question-answering,A number of recent works have proposed attention models for Visual Question Answering (VQA) that generate spatial maps highlighting image regions relevant to answering the question. In this paper; we argue that in addition to modeling "where to look" or visual attention; it is equally important to model "what words to listen to" or question attention. We present a novel co-attention model for VQA that jointly reasons about image and question attention. In addition; our model reasons about the question (and consequently the image via the co-attention mechanism) in a hierarchical fashion via a novel 1-dimensional convolution neural networks (CNN). Our model improves the state-of-the-art on the VQA dataset from 60.3% to 60.5%; and from 61.6% to 63.3% on the COCO-QA dataset. By using ResNet; the performance is further improved to 62.1% for VQA and 65.4% for COCO-QA.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6202-hierarchical-question-image-co-attention-for-visual-question-answering/bibtex,Jiasen Lu; Jianwei Yang; Dhruv Batra; Devi Parikh

On the other hand; modeling structural information has been proved critical in many vision problems. It is of great interest to integrate them effectively. In a classical neural network; there is no message passing between neurons in the same layer. In this paper; we propose a CRF-CNN framework which can simultaneously model structural information in both output and hidden feature layers in a probabilistic way; and it is applied to human pose estimation. A message passing scheme is proposed; so that in various layers each body joint receives messages from all the others in an efficient way. Such message passing can be implemented with convolution between features maps in the same layer; and it is also integrated with feedforward propagation in neural networks. Finally; a neural network implementation of end-to-end learning CRF-CNN is provided. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6278-crf-cnn-modeling-structured-information-in-human-pose-estimation/bibtex,Xiao Chu; Wanli Ouyang; hongsheng Li; Xiaogang Wang

By using a series of code transformations; the evidence of any probabilistic program; and therefore of any graphical model; can be optimized with respect to an arbitrary subset of its sampled variables.  To carry out this optimization; we develop the first Bayesian optimization package to directly exploit the source code of its target; leading to innovations in problem-independent hyperpriors; unbounded optimization; and implicit constraint satisfaction; delivering significant performance improvements over prominent existing packages.

2016,Cooperative Graphical Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6122-cooperative-graphical-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6122-cooperative-graphical-models,We study a rich family of distributions that capture variable interactions significantly more expressive than those representable with low-treewidth or pairwise graphical models; or log-supermodular models. We call these cooperative graphical models. Yet; this family retains structure; which we carefully exploit for efficient inference techniques. Our algorithms combine the polyhedral structure of submodular functions in new ways with variational inference methods to obtain both lower and upper bounds on the partition function. While our fully convex upper bound is minimized as an SDP or via tree-reweighted belief propagation; our lower bound is tightened via belief propagation or mean-field algorithms. The resulting algorithms are easy to implement and; as our experiments show; effectively obtain good bounds and marginals for synthetic and real-world examples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6122-cooperative-graphical-models/bibtex,Josip Djolonga; Stefanie Jegelka; Sebastian Tschiatschek; Andreas Krause
2016,CNNpack: Packing Convolutional Neural Networks in the Frequency Domain,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6390-cnnpack-packing-convolutional-neural-networks-in-the-frequency-domain.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6390-cnnpack-packing-convolutional-neural-networks-in-the-frequency-domain,Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are successfully used in a number of applications. However; their storage and computational requirements have largely prevented their widespread use on mobile devices. Here we present an effective CNN compression approach in the frequency domain; which focuses not only on smaller weights but on all the weights and their underlying connections. By treating convolutional filters as images; we decompose their representations in the frequency domain as common parts (i.e.; cluster centers) shared by other similar filters and their individual private parts (i.e.; individual residuals). A large number of low-energy frequency coefficients in both parts can be discarded to produce high compression without significantly compromising accuracy. We relax the computational burden of convolution operations in CNNs by linearly combining the convolution responses of discrete cosine transform (DCT) bases. The compression and speed-up ratios of the proposed algorithm are thoroughly analyzed and evaluated on benchmark image datasets to demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6390-cnnpack-packing-convolutional-neural-networks-in-the-frequency-domain/bibtex,Yunhe Wang; Chang Xu; Shan You; Dacheng Tao; Chao Xu

In order to capture some of these advantages in machine perception; we ask two questions: whether deep neural networks can learn universal image representations; useful not only for a single task but for all of them; and how the solutions to the different tasks can be integrated in this framework. We answer by proposing a new architecture; which we call multinet; in which not only deep image features are shared between tasks; but where tasks can interact in a recurrent manner by encoding the results of their analysis in a common shared representation of the data. In this manner; we show that the performance of individual tasks in standard benchmarks can be improved first by sharing features between them and then; more significantly; by integrating their solutions in the common representation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6393-integrated-perception-with-recurrent-multi-task-neural-networks/bibtex,Hakan Bilen; Andrea Vedaldi

SAPALM is the first asynchronous parallel optimization method that provably converges on a large class of nonconvex; nonsmooth problems. We prove that SAPALM matches the best known rates of convergence --- among synchronous or asynchronous methods --- on this problem class. We provide upper bounds on the number of workers for which we can expect to see a linear speedup; which match the best bounds known for less complex problems; and show that in practice SAPALM achieves this linear speedup. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several matrix factorization problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6428-the-sound-of-apalm-clapping-faster-nonsmooth-nonconvex-optimization-with-stochastic-asynchronous-palm/bibtex,Damek Davis; Brent Edmunds; Madeleine Udell

We prove that under minimal assumptions; it is enough to have a consistent univariate independence test on the distances; to guarantee that the power to detect dependence between the random vectors increases to one with sample size.  If the univariate test is  distribution-free; the multivariate test will also be distribution-free. If we consider multiple center points and aggregate the  center-specific univariate tests; the power may be further improved; and the resulting multivariate test may be distribution-free for specific aggregation methods (if the univariate test is distribution-free).  We show that certain multivariate tests recently proposed in the literature can be viewed as instances of this general approach. Moreover; we show in experiments that novel tests constructed using our approach can have better power and computational time than competing approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6220-multivariate-tests-of-association-based-on-univariate-tests/bibtex,Ruth Heller; Yair Heller

Inspired by the transferability properties of CNNs; we introduce an additional unsupervised meta-training stage that exposes multiple top layer units to a large amount of unlabeled real-world images. By encouraging these units to learn diverse sets of low-density separators across the unlabeled data; we capture a more generic; richer description of the visual world; which decouples these units from ties to a specific set of categories. We propose an unsupervised margin maximization that jointly estimates compact high-density regions and infers low-density separators. The low-density separator (LDS) modules can be plugged into any or all of the top layers of a standard CNN architecture. The resulting CNNs significantly improve the performance in scene classification; fine-grained recognition; and action recognition with small training samples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6408-learning-from-small-sample-sets-by-combining-unsupervised-meta-training-with-cnns/bibtex,Yu-Xiong Wang; Martial Hebert

The features are chosen so as to maximize the distinguishability of the distributions; by optimizing a lower bound on test power for a statistical test using these features. The result is a parsimonious and interpretable indication of how and where two distributions differ locally. An empirical estimate of the test power criterion converges with increasing sample size; ensuring the quality of the returned features. In real-world benchmarks on high-dimensional text and image data; linear-time tests using the proposed semimetrics achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art quadratic-time maximum mean discrepancy test; while returning human-interpretable features that explain the test results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6148-interpretable-distribution-features-with-maximum-testing-power/bibtex,Wittawat Jitkrittum; Zolt?n Szab?; Kacper P.

The approach infers and reasons about the underlying 3D planar surfaces depicted in the image to snap predicted normals and depths to inferred planar surfaces; all while maintaining fine detail within objects. Our approach comprises two components: (i) a fourstream convolutional neural network (CNN) where depths; surface normals; and likelihoods of planar region and planar boundary are predicted at each pixel; followed by (ii) a dense conditional random field (DCRF) that integrates the four predictions such that the normals and depths are compatible with each other and regularized by the planar region and planar boundary information. The DCRF is formulated such that gradients can be passed to the surface normal and depth CNNs via backpropagation. In addition; we propose new planar wise metrics to evaluate geometry consistency within planar surfaces; which are more tightly related to dependent 3D editing applications. We show that our regularization yields a 30% relative improvement in planar consistency on the NYU v2 dataset.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6502-surge-surface-regularized-geometry-estimation-from-a-single-image/bibtex,Peng Wang; Xiaohui Shen; Bryan Russell; Scott Cohen; Brian Price; Alan L.

While existing models can synthesize images based on global constraints such as a class label or caption; they do not provide control over pose or object location. We propose a new model; the Generative Adversarial What-Where Network (GAWWN); that synthesizes images given instructions describing what content to draw in which location. We show high-quality 128 ? 128 image synthesis on the Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset; conditioned on both informal text descriptions and also object location. Our system exposes control over both the bounding box around the bird and its constituent parts. By modeling the conditional distributions over part locations; our system also enables conditioning on arbitrary subsets of parts (e.g. only the beak and tail); yielding an efficient interface for picking part locations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6111-learning-what-and-where-to-draw/bibtex,Scott E.

We start with the previously unnoticed empirical observation that; given a collection (a cloud) of data points; the sublevel sets of a certain distinguished polynomial capture the shape of the cloud very accurately. This distinguished polynomial is a sum-of-squares (SOS) derived in a simple manner from the inverse of the empirical moment matrix. In fact; this SOS polynomial is directly related to orthogonal polynomials and the Christoffel function. This allows to generalize and interpret extremality properties of orthogonal polynomials and to provide a mathematical rationale for the observed phenomenon. Among diverse potential applications; we illustrate the relevance of our results on a network intrusion detection task for which we obtain performances similar to existing dedicated methods reported in the literature.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6495-sorting-out-typicality-with-the-inverse-moment-matrix-sos-polynomial/bibtex,Edouard Pauwels; Jean B.

2016,Multi-armed Bandits: Competing with Optimal Sequences,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6341-multi-armed-bandits-competing-with-optimal-sequences.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6341-multi-armed-bandits-competing-with-optimal-sequences,We consider sequential decision making problem in the adversarial setting; where regret is measured with respect to the optimal sequence of actions and the feedback adheres the bandit setting. It is well-known that obtaining sublinear regret in this setting is impossible in general; which arises the question of when can we do better than linear regret? Previous works show that when the environment is guaranteed to vary slowly and furthermore we are given prior knowledge regarding its variation (i.e.; a limit on the amount of changes suffered by the environment); then this task is feasible. The caveat however is that such prior knowledge is not likely to be available in practice; which causes the obtained regret bounds to be somewhat irrelevant.   Our main result is a regret guarantee that scales with the variation parameter of the environment; without requiring any prior knowledge about it whatsoever. By that; we also resolve an open problem posted by [Gur; Zeevi and Besbes; NIPS' 14]. An important key component in our result is a statistical test for identifying non-stationarity in a sequence of independent random variables. This test either identifies non-stationarity or upper-bounds the absolute deviation of the corresponding sequence of mean values in terms of its total variation. This test is interesting on its own right and has the potential to be found useful in additional settings.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6341-multi-armed-bandits-competing-with-optimal-sequences/bibtex,Zohar S.

2016,Minimizing Regret on Reflexive Banach Spaces and Nash Equilibria in Continuous Zero-Sum Games,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6216-minimizing-regret-on-reflexive-banach-spaces-and-nash-equilibria-in-continuous-zero-sum-games.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6216-minimizing-regret-on-reflexive-banach-spaces-and-nash-equilibria-in-continuous-zero-sum-games,We study a general adversarial online learning problem; in which we are given a decision set X' in a reflexive Banach space X and a sequence of reward vectors in the dual space of X. At each iteration; we choose an action from X'; based on the observed sequence of previous rewards. Our goal is to minimize regret; defined as the gap between the realized reward and the reward of the best fixed action in hindsight. Using results from infinite dimensional convex analysis; we generalize the method of Dual Averaging (or Follow the Regularized Leader) to our setting and obtain upper bounds on the worst-case regret that generalize many previous results. Under the assumption of uniformly continuous rewards; we obtain explicit regret bounds in a setting where the decision set is the set of probability distributions on a compact metric space S. Importantly; we make no convexity assumptions on either the set S or the reward functions. We also prove a general lower bound on the worst-case regret for any online algorithm. We then apply these results to the problem of learning in repeated two-player zero-sum games on compact metric spaces. In doing so; we first prove that if both players play a Hannan-consistent strategy; then with probability 1 the empirical distributions of play weakly converge to the set of Nash equilibria of the game. We then show that; under mild assumptions; Dual Averaging on the (infinite-dimensional) space of probability distributions indeed achieves Hannan-consistency.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6216-minimizing-regret-on-reflexive-banach-spaces-and-nash-equilibria-in-continuous-zero-sum-games/bibtex,Maximilian Balandat; Walid Krichene; Claire Tomlin; Alexandre Bayen
2016,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Residual Transfer Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6110-unsupervised-domain-adaptation-with-residual-transfer-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6110-unsupervised-domain-adaptation-with-residual-transfer-networks,The recent success of deep neural networks relies on massive amounts of labeled data. For a target task where labeled data is unavailable; domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain. In this paper; we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep networks that can jointly learn adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. We relax a shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. We enable classifier adaptation by plugging several layers into deep network to explicitly learn the residual function with reference to the target classifier. We fuse features of multiple layers with tensor product and embed them into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to match distributions for feature adaptation. The adaptation can be achieved in most feed-forward models by extending them with new residual layers and loss functions; which can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Empirical evidence shows that the new approach outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6110-unsupervised-domain-adaptation-with-residual-transfer-networks/bibtex,Mingsheng Long; Han Zhu; Jianmin Wang; Michael I.

Here we experimentally tested the predictions made by a formalization of bounded rationality based on ideas from statistical mechanics and information-theory. We systematically tested human subjects in their ability to solve combinatorial puzzles under different time limitations. We found that our bounded-rational model accounts well for the data. The decomposition of the fitted model parameter into the subjects' expected utility function and resource parameter provide interesting insight into the subjects' information capacity limits. Our results confirm that humans gradually fall back on their learned prior choice patterns when confronted with increasing resource limitations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6249-human-decision-making-under-limited-time/bibtex,Pedro A.

In contrast to traditional methods; which have tackled this problem in a deterministic or non-parametric way; we propose a novel approach which models future frames in a probabilistic manner. Our proposed method is therefore able to synthesize multiple possible next frames using the same model. Solving this challenging problem involves low- and high-level image and motion understanding for successful image synthesis. Here; we propose a novel network structure; namely a Cross Convolutional Network; that encodes images as feature maps and motion information as convolutional kernels to aid in synthesizing future frames. In experiments; our model performs well on both synthetic data; such as 2D shapes and animated game sprites; as well as on real-wold video data. We show that our model can also be applied to tasks such as visual analogy-making; and present analysis of the learned network representations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6552-visual-dynamics-probabilistic-future-frame-synthesis-via-cross-convolutional-networks/bibtex,Tianfan Xue; Jiajun Wu; Katherine Bouman; Bill Freeman
2016,Verification Based Solution for Structured MAB Problems,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6525-verification-based-solution-for-structured-mab-problems.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6525-verification-based-solution-for-structured-mab-problems,We consider the problem of finding the best arm in a stochastic Mutli-armed Bandit (MAB) game and propose a general framework based on verification that applies to multiple well-motivated generalizations of the classic MAB problem. In these generalizations; additional structure is known in advance; causing the task of verifying the optimality of a candidate to be  easier than discovering the best arm. Our results are focused on the scenario where the failure probability $\delta$ must be very low; we essentially show that in this high confidence regime; identifying the best arm is as easy as the task of verification.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it; and improving the state-of-the art results in the problems of: Linear bandits; Dueling bandits with the Condorcet assumption; Copeland dueling bandits; Unimodal bandits and Graphical bandits.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6525-verification-based-solution-for-structured-mab-problems/bibtex,Zohar S.

2016,Linear dynamical neural population models through nonlinear embeddings,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6430-linear-dynamical-neural-population-models-through-nonlinear-embeddings.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6430-linear-dynamical-neural-population-models-through-nonlinear-embeddings,A body of recent work in modeling neural activity focuses on recovering low- dimensional latent features that capture the statistical structure of large-scale neural populations. Most such approaches have focused on linear generative models; where inference is computationally tractable. Here; we propose fLDS; a general class of nonlinear generative models that permits the firing rate of each neuron to vary as an arbitrary smooth function of a latent; linear dynamical state. This extra flexibility allows the model to capture a richer set of neural variability than a purely linear model; but retains an easily visualizable low-dimensional latent space. To fit this class of non-conjugate models we propose a variational inference scheme; along with a novel approximate posterior capable of capturing rich temporal correlations across time. We show that our techniques permit inference in a wide class of generative models.We also show in application to two neural datasets that; compared to state-of-the-art neural population models; fLDS captures a much larger proportion of neural variability with a small number of latent dimensions; providing superior predictive performance and interpretability.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6430-linear-dynamical-neural-population-models-through-nonlinear-embeddings/bibtex,Yuanjun Gao; Evan W.

2016,Tree-Structured Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Object Localization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6532-tree-structured-reinforcement-learning-for-sequential-object-localization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6532-tree-structured-reinforcement-learning-for-sequential-object-localization,Existing object proposal algorithms usually search for possible object regions over multiple locations and scales \emph{ separately}; which ignore the interdependency among different objects and deviate from the human perception procedure. To incorporate global interdependency between objects into object localization; we propose an effective Tree-structured Reinforcement Learning (Tree-RL) approach to sequentially search for objects by fully exploiting both the current observation and  historical search paths. The Tree-RL approach learns multiple  searching policies through maximizing the long-term reward that reflects localization accuracies over all the objects. Starting with taking the entire image as a proposal; the Tree-RL approach allows the agent to sequentially discover multiple objects via a  tree-structured traversing scheme.  Allowing multiple near-optimal policies; Tree-RL  offers more diversity in search paths and is able to find multiple objects with a single feed-forward pass. Therefore; Tree-RL can better cover different objects with various scales which is quite appealing in the context of object proposal. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 validate the effectiveness of the Tree-RL; which can achieve comparable recalls with current object proposal algorithms via much fewer candidate windows.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6532-tree-structured-reinforcement-learning-for-sequential-object-localization/bibtex,Zequn Jie; Xiaodan Liang; Jiashi Feng; Xiaojie Jin; Wen Lu; Shuicheng Yan
2016,Natural-Parameter Networks: A Class of Probabilistic Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6279-natural-parameter-networks-a-class-of-probabilistic-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6279-natural-parameter-networks-a-class-of-probabilistic-neural-networks,Neural networks (NN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications. Unfortunately in applications where training data is insufficient; they are often prone to overfitting. One effective way to alleviate this problem is to exploit the Bayesian approach by using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Another shortcoming of NN is the lack of flexibility to customize different distributions for the weights and neurons according to the data; as is often done in probabilistic graphical models. To address these problems; we propose a class of probabilistic neural networks; dubbed natural-parameter networks (NPN); as a novel and lightweight Bayesian treatment of NN. NPN allows the usage of arbitrary exponential-family distributions to model the weights and neurons. Different from traditional NN and BNN; NPN takes distributions as input and goes through layers of transformation before producing distributions to match the target output distributions. As a Bayesian treatment; efficient backpropagation (BP) is performed to learn the natural parameters for the distributions over both the weights and neurons. The output distributions of each layer; as byproducts; may be used as second-order representations for the associated tasks such as link prediction. Experiments on real-world datasets show that NPN can achieve state-of-the-art performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6279-natural-parameter-networks-a-class-of-probabilistic-neural-networks/bibtex,Hao Wang; Xingjian SHI; Dit-Yan Yeung
2016,Incremental Boosting Convolutional Neural Network for Facial Action Unit Recognition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6258-incremental-boosting-convolutional-neural-network-for-facial-action-unit-recognition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6258-incremental-boosting-convolutional-neural-network-for-facial-action-unit-recognition,Recognizing facial action units (AUs) from spontaneous facial expressions is still a challenging problem. Most recently; CNNs have shown promise on facial AU recognition. However; the learned CNNs are often overfitted and do not generalize well to unseen subjects due to limited AU-coded training images. We proposed a novel Incremental Boosting CNN (IB-CNN) to integrate boosting into the CNN via an incremental boosting layer that selects discriminative neurons from the lower layer and is incrementally updated on successive mini-batches. In addition; a novel loss function that accounts for errors from both the incremental boosted classifier and individual weak classifiers was proposed to fine-tune the IB-CNN. Experimental results on four benchmark AU databases have demonstrated that the IB-CNN yields significant improvement over the traditional CNN and the boosting CNN without incremental learning; as well as outperforming the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods in AU recognition. The improvement is more impressive for the AUs that have the lowest frequencies in the databases.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6258-incremental-boosting-convolutional-neural-network-for-facial-action-unit-recognition/bibtex,Shizhong Han; Zibo Meng; AHMED-SHEHAB KHAN; Yan Tong
2016,Fast and Provably Good Seedings for k-Means,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6478-fast-and-provably-good-seedings-for-k-means.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6478-fast-and-provably-good-seedings-for-k-means,Seeding - the task of finding initial cluster centers - is critical in obtaining high-quality clusterings for k-Means. However; k-means++ seeding; the state of the art algorithm; does not scale well to massive datasets as it is inherently sequential and requires k full passes through the data. It was recently shown that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can be used to efficiently approximate the seeding step of k-means++. However; this result requires assumptions on the data generating distribution.  We propose a simple yet fast seeding algorithm that produces *provably* good clusterings even *without assumptions* on the data. Our analysis shows that the algorithm allows for a favourable trade-off between solution quality and computational cost; speeding up k-means++ seeding by up to several orders of magnitude. We validate our theoretical results in extensive experiments on a variety of real-world data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6478-fast-and-provably-good-seedings-for-k-means/bibtex,Olivier Bachem; Mario Lucic; Hamed Hassani; Andreas Krause

We cast the problem as finding a completion of the data matrix so that each point can be reconstructed as a linear or affine combination of a few data points. Since the problem is NP-hard; we propose a lifting framework and reformulate the problem as a group-sparse recovery of each incomplete data point in a dictionary built using incomplete data; subject to rank-one constraints. To solve the problem efficiently; we propose a rank pursuit algorithm and a convex relaxation. The solution of our algorithms recover missing entries and provides a similarity matrix for clustering. Our algorithms can deal with both low-rank and high-rank matrices; does not suffer from initialization; does not need to know dimensions of subspaces and can work with a small number of data points. By extensive experiments on synthetic data and real problems of video motion segmentation and completion of motion capture data; we show that when the data matrix is low-rank; our algorithm performs on par with or better than low-rank matrix completion methods; while for high-rank data matrices; our method significantly outperforms existing algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6357-high-rank-matrix-completion-and-clustering-under-self-expressive-models/bibtex,Ehsan Elhamifar

We propose a novel framework; namely 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN); which generates 3D objects from a probabilistic space by leveraging recent advances in volumetric convolutional networks and generative adversarial nets. The benefits of our model are three-fold: first; the use of an adversarial criterion; instead of traditional heuristic criteria; enables the generator to capture object structure implicitly and to synthesize high-quality 3D objects; second; the generator establishes a mapping from a low-dimensional probabilistic space to the space of 3D objects; so that we can sample objects without a reference image or CAD models; and explore the 3D object manifold; third; the adversarial discriminator provides a powerful 3D shape descriptor which; learned without supervision; has wide applications in 3D object recognition. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality 3D objects; and our unsupervisedly learned features achieve impressive performance on 3D object recognition; comparable with those of supervised learning methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6096-learning-a-probabilistic-latent-space-of-object-shapes-via-3d-generative-adversarial-modeling/bibtex,Jiajun Wu; Chengkai Zhang; Tianfan Xue; Bill Freeman; Josh Tenenbaum
2016,Unsupervised Learning for Physical Interaction through Video Prediction,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6161-unsupervised-learning-for-physical-interaction-through-video-prediction.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6161-unsupervised-learning-for-physical-interaction-through-video-prediction,A core challenge for an agent learning to interact with the world is to predict how its actions affect objects in its environment. Many existing methods for learning the dynamics of physical interactions require labeled object information. However; to scale real-world interaction learning to a variety of scenes and objects; acquiring labeled data becomes increasingly impractical. To learn about physical object motion without labels; we develop an action-conditioned video prediction model that explicitly models pixel motion; by predicting a distribution over pixel motion from previous frames. Because our model explicitly predicts motion; it is partially invariant to object appearance; enabling it to generalize to previously unseen objects. To explore video prediction for real-world interactive agents; we also introduce a dataset of 59;000 robot interactions involving pushing motions; including a test set with novel objects. In this dataset; accurate prediction of videos conditioned on the robot's future actions amounts to learning a "visual imagination" of different futures based on different courses of action. Our experiments show that our proposed method produces more accurate video predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively; when compared to prior methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6161-unsupervised-learning-for-physical-interaction-through-video-prediction/bibtex,Chelsea Finn; Ian Goodfellow; Sergey Levine
2016,On Regularizing Rademacher Observation Losses,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6572-on-regularizing-rademacher-observation-losses.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6572-on-regularizing-rademacher-observation-losses,It has recently been shown that supervised learning linear classifiers with two of the most popular losses; the logistic and square loss; is equivalent to optimizing an equivalent loss over sufficient statistics about the class: Rademacher observations (rados). It has also been shown that learning over rados brings solutions to two prominent problems for which the state of the art of learning from examples can be comparatively inferior and in fact less convenient: protecting and learning from private examples; learning from distributed datasets without entity resolution.   Bis repetita placent: the two proofs of equivalence are different and rely on specific properties of the corresponding losses; so whether these can be unified and generalized inevitably comes to mind. This is our first contribution: we show how they can be fit into the same theory for the equivalence between example and rado losses. As a second contribution; we show that the generalization unveils a surprising new connection to regularized learning; and in particular a sufficient condition under which regularizing the loss over examples is equivalent to regularizing the rados (i.e. the data) in the equivalent rado loss; in such a way that an efficient algorithm for one regularized rado loss may be as efficient when changing the regularizer. This is our third contribution: we give a formal boosting algorithm for the regularized exponential rado-loss which boost with any of the ridge; lasso; \slope; l_\infty; or elastic nets; using the same master routine for all. Because the regularized exponential rado-loss is the equivalent of the regularized logistic loss over examples we obtain the first efficient proxy to the minimisation of the regularized logistic loss over examples using such a wide spectrum of regularizers. Experiments with a readily available code display that regularization significantly improves rado-based learning and compares favourably with example-based learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6572-on-regularizing-rademacher-observation-losses/bibtex,Richard Nock
2016,A scaled Bregman theorem with applications,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6176-a-scaled-bregman-theorem-with-applications.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6176-a-scaled-bregman-theorem-with-applications,Bregman divergences play a central role in the design and analysis of a range of machine learning algorithms through a handful of popular theorems. We present a new theorem which shows that ``Bregman distortions'' (employing a potentially non-convex generator) may be exactly re-written as a scaled Bregman divergence computed over transformed data. This property can be viewed from the standpoints of geometry (a scaled isometry with adaptive metrics) or convex optimization (relating generalized perspective transforms). Admissible distortions include {geodesic distances} on curved manifolds and projections or gauge-normalisation.  Our theorem allows one to leverage to the wealth and convenience of Bregman divergences when analysing algorithms relying on the aforementioned Bregman distortions.  We illustrate this with three novel applications of our theorem: a reduction from multi-class density ratio to class-probability estimation; a new adaptive projection free yet norm-enforcing  dual norm mirror descent algorithm;  and a reduction from clustering on flat manifolds to clustering on curved manifolds. Experiments on each of these domains validate the analyses and suggest that the scaled Bregman theorem might be a worthy addition to the popular handful of Bregman divergence properties that have been pervasive in machine learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6176-a-scaled-bregman-theorem-with-applications/bibtex,Richard Nock; Aditya Menon; Cheng Soon Ong
2016,Without-Replacement Sampling for Stochastic Gradient Methods,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6245-without-replacement-sampling-for-stochastic-gradient-methods.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6245-without-replacement-sampling-for-stochastic-gradient-methods,Stochastic gradient methods for machine learning and optimization problems are usually analyzed assuming data points are sampled *with* replacement. In contrast; sampling *without* replacement is far less understood; yet in practice it is very common; often easier to implement; and usually performs better. In this paper; we provide competitive convergence guarantees for without-replacement sampling under several scenarios; focusing on the natural regime of few passes over the data. Moreover; we describe a useful application of these results in the context of distributed optimization with randomly-partitioned data; yielding a nearly-optimal algorithm for regularized least squares (in terms of both communication complexity and runtime complexity) under broad parameter regimes. Our proof techniques combine ideas from stochastic optimization; adversarial online learning and transductive learning theory; and can potentially be applied to other stochastic optimization and learning problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6245-without-replacement-sampling-for-stochastic-gradient-methods/bibtex,Ohad Shamir
2017,Mean Field Residual Networks: On the Edge of Chaos,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6879-mean-field-residual-networks-on-the-edge-of-chaos.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6879-mean-field-residual-networks-on-the-edge-of-chaos,We study randomly initialized residual networks using mean field theory and the theory of difference equations. Classical feedforward neural networks; such as those with tanh activations; exhibit exponential behavior on the average when propagating inputs forward or gradients backward. The exponential forward dynamics causes rapid collapsing of the input space geometry; while the exponential backward dynamics causes drastic vanishing or exploding gradients. We show; in contrast; that by adding skip connections; the network will; depending on the nonlinearity; adopt subexponential forward and backward dynamics; and in many cases in fact polynomial. The exponents of these polynomials are obtained through analytic methods and proved and verified empirically to be correct. In terms of the "edge of chaos" hypothesis; these subexponential and polynomial laws allow residual networks to "hover over the boundary between stability and chaos;" thus preserving the geometry of the input space and the gradient information flow. In our experiments; for each activation function we study here; we initialize residual networks with different hyperparameters and train them on MNIST. Remarkably; our initialization time theory can accurately predict test time performance of these networks; by tracking either the expected amount of gradient explosion or the expected squared distance between the images of two input vectors. Importantly; we show; theoretically as well as empirically; that common initializations such as the Xavier or the He schemes are not optimal for residual networks; because the optimal initialization variances depend on the depth. Finally; we have made mathematical contributions by deriving several new identities for the kernels of powers of ReLU functions by relating them to the zeroth Bessel function of the second kind.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6879-mean-field-residual-networks-on-the-edge-of-chaos/bibtex,Ge Yang; Samuel Schoenholz

There are two common scan orders for the variables: random scan and systematic scan. Due to the benefits of locality in hardware; systematic scan is commonly used; even though most statistical guarantees are only for random scan. While it has been conjectured that the mixing times of random scan and systematic scan do not differ by more than a logarithmic factor; we show by counterexample that this is not the case; and we prove that that the mixing times do not differ by more than a polynomial factor under mild conditions. To prove these relative bounds; we introduce a method of augmenting the state space to study systematic scan using conductance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6589-scan-order-in-gibbs-sampling-models-in-which-it-matters-and-bounds-on-how-much/bibtex,Bryan D.

Swapout samples from a rich set of architectures including dropout; stochastic depth and residual architectures as special cases. When viewed as a regularization method swapout not only inhibits co-adaptation of units in a layer; similar to dropout; but also across network layers. We conjecture that swapout achieves strong regularization by implicitly tying the parameters across layers. When viewed as an ensemble training method; it samples a much richer set of architectures than existing methods such as dropout or stochastic depth. We propose a parameterization that reveals connections to exiting architectures and suggests a much richer set of architectures to be explored. We show that our formulation suggests an efficient training method and validate our conclusions on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 matching state of the art accuracy. Remarkably; our 32 layer wider model performs similar to a 1001 layer ResNet model.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6205-swapout-learning-an-ensemble-of-deep-architectures/bibtex,Saurabh Singh; Derek Hoiem; David Forsyth
2016,Deep ADMM-Net for Compressive Sensing MRI,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6406-deep-admm-net-for-compressive-sensing-mri.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6406-deep-admm-net-for-compressive-sensing-mri,Compressive Sensing (CS) is an effective approach for fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It aims at reconstructing MR image from a small number of  under-sampled data in k-space; and accelerating the data acquisition in MRI.  To improve the current MRI system in reconstruction accuracy and computational speed;  in this paper; we propose a novel deep architecture; dubbed ADMM-Net.  ADMM-Net is defined over a data flow graph; which is derived from the iterative  procedures in Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for optimizing a CS-based MRI model. In the training phase; all parameters of the net; e.g.; image transforms; shrinkage functions; etc.; are discriminatively trained end-to-end using L-BFGS algorithm. In the testing phase; it has computational overhead similar to ADMM but uses optimized parameters learned from the  training data for CS-based reconstruction task. Experiments on MRI image  reconstruction under different sampling ratios in k-space demonstrate that it significantly improves the baseline ADMM algorithm and achieves high reconstruction  accuracies with fast computational speed.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6406-deep-admm-net-for-compressive-sensing-mri/bibtex,yan yang; Jian Sun; Huibin Li; Zongben Xu
2017,Multi-view Matrix Factorization for Linear Dynamical System Estimation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7284-multi-view-matrix-factorization-for-linear-dynamical-system-estimation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7284-multi-view-matrix-factorization-for-linear-dynamical-system-estimation,We consider maximum likelihood estimation of linear dynamical systems with generalized-linear observation models. Maximum likelihood is typically considered to be hard in this setting since latent states and transition parameters must be inferred jointly. Given that expectation-maximization does not scale and is prone to local minima; moment-matching approaches from the subspace identification literature have become standard; despite known statistical efficiency issues. In this paper; we instead reconsider likelihood maximization and develop an optimization based strategy for recovering the latent states and transition parameters. Key to the approach is a two-view reformulation of maximum likelihood estimation for linear dynamical systems that enables the use of global optimization algorithms for matrix factorization. We show that the proposed estimation strategy outperforms widely-used identification algorithms such as subspace identification methods; both in terms of accuracy and runtime.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7284-multi-view-matrix-factorization-for-linear-dynamical-system-estimation/bibtex,Mahdi Karami; Martha White; Dale Schuurmans; Csaba Szepesvari
2017,A General Framework for Robust Interactive Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7283-a-general-framework-for-robust-interactive-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7283-a-general-framework-for-robust-interactive-learning,We propose a general framework for interactively learning models; such as (binary or non-binary) classifiers; orderings/rankings of items; or clusterings of data points. Our framework is based on a generalization of Angluin's equivalence query model and Littlestone's online learning model: in each iteration; the algorithm proposes a model; and the user either accepts it or reveals a specific mistake in the proposal. The feedback is correct only with probability p > 1/2 (and adversarially incorrect with probability 1 - p); i.e.; the algorithm must be able to learn in the presence of arbitrary noise. The algorithm's goal is to learn the ground truth model using few iterations.  Our general framework is based on a graph representation of the models and user feedback. To be able to learn efficiently; it is sufficient that there be a graph G whose nodes are the models; and (weighted) edges capture the user feedback; with the property that if s; s* are the proposed and target models; respectively; then any (correct) user feedback s' must lie on a shortest s-s* path in G. Under this one assumption; there is a natural algorithm; reminiscent of the Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm; which will efficiently learn s* even in the presence of noise in the user's feedback.  From this general result; we rederive with barely any extra effort classic results on learning of classifiers and a recent result on interactive clustering; in addition; we easily obtain new interactive learning algorithms for ordering/ranking.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7283-a-general-framework-for-robust-interactive-learning/bibtex,Ehsan Emamjomeh-Zadeh; David Kempe

While being able to cluster within a network is important; there are emerging needs to be able to \emph{cluster multiple networks}. This is largely motivated by the routine collection of network data that are generated from potentially different populations. These networks may or may not have node correspondence. When node correspondence is present; we cluster networks by summarizing a network by its graphon estimate; whereas when node correspondence is not present; we propose a novel solution for clustering such networks by associating a computationally feasible feature vector to each network based on trace of powers of the adjacency matrix. We illustrate our methods using both simulated and real data sets; and theoretical justifications are provided in terms of consistency.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7282-on-clustering-network-valued-data/bibtex,Soumendu Sundar Mukherjee; Purnamrita Sarkar; Lizhen Lin

Towards this; we develop novel technical machinery; including a notion of separability of general loss functions; which allow us to provide a general framework to obtain l? convergence rates for general M-estimators. We use this machinery to analyze l? and l2 convergence rates of generative and discriminative models; and provide insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions. Our results are also applicable to differential parameter estimation; where the quantity of interest is the difference between generative model parameters.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7280-on-separability-of-loss-functions-and-revisiting-discriminative-vs-generative-models/bibtex,Adarsh Prasad; Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil; Pradeep K.

To solve such problems; we focus on the widely used stochastic mirror descent (SMD) family of algorithms (which contains stochastic gradient descent as a special case); and we show that the last iterate of SMD converges to the problem?s solution set with probability 1. This result contributes to the landscape of non-convex stochastic optimization by clarifying that neither pseudo-/quasi-convexity nor star-convexity is essential for (almost sure) global convergence; rather; variational coherence; a much weaker requirement; suffices. Characterization of convergence rates for the subclass of strongly variationally coherent optimization problems as well as simulation results are also presented.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7279-stochastic-mirror-descent-in-variationally-coherent-optimization-problems/bibtex,Zhengyuan Zhou; Panayotis Mertikopoulos; Nicholas Bambos; Stephen Boyd; Peter W.

2017,Experimental Design for Learning Causal Graphs with Latent Variables,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7277-experimental-design-for-learning-causal-graphs-with-latent-variables.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7277-experimental-design-for-learning-causal-graphs-with-latent-variables,We consider the problem of learning causal structures with latent variables using interventions. Our objective is not only to learn the causal graph between the observed variables; but to locate unobserved variables that could confound the relationship between observables. Our approach is stage-wise: We first learn the observable graph; i.e.; the induced graph between observable variables. Next we learn the existence and location of the latent variables given the observable graph. We propose an efficient randomized algorithm that can learn the observable graph using O(d\log^2 n) interventions where d is the degree of the graph. We further propose an efficient deterministic variant which uses O(log n + l) interventions; where l is the longest directed path in the graph. Next; we propose an algorithm that uses only O(d^2 log n) interventions that can learn the latents between both non-adjacent and adjacent variables. While a naive baseline approach would require O(n^2) interventions; our combined algorithm can learn the causal graph with latents using O(d log^2 n + d^2 log (n)) interventions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7277-experimental-design-for-learning-causal-graphs-with-latent-variables/bibtex,Murat Kocaoglu; Karthikeyan Shanmugam; Elias Bareinboim

So far; most existing methods only work for classification and are not designed to alter the true performance measure of the problem at hand. We introduce a novel flexible approach named Houdini for generating adversarial examples specifically tailored for the final performance measure of the task considered; be it combinatorial and non-decomposable. We successfully apply Houdini to a range of applications such as speech recognition; pose estimation and semantic segmentation. In all cases; the attacks based on Houdini achieve higher success rate than those based on the traditional surrogates used to train the models while using a less perceptible adversarial perturbation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7273-houdini-fooling-deep-structured-visual-and-speech-recognition-models-with-adversarial-examples/bibtex,Moustapha M.

2017,Learning to Model the Tail,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7278-learning-to-model-the-tail.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7278-learning-to-model-the-tail,We describe an approach to learning from long-tailed; imbalanced datasets that are prevalent in real-world settings.  Here; the challenge is to learn accurate "few-shot'' models for classes in the tail of the class distribution; for which little data is available. We cast this problem as transfer learning; where knowledge from the data-rich classes in the head of the distribution is transferred to the data-poor classes in the tail. Our key insights are as follows. First; we propose to transfer meta-knowledge about learning-to-learn from the head classes. This knowledge is encoded with a meta-network that operates on the space of model parameters; that is trained to predict many-shot model parameters from few-shot model parameters.  Second; we transfer this meta-knowledge in a progressive manner; from classes in the head to the "body''; and from the "body'' to the tail. That is; we transfer knowledge in a gradual fashion; regularizing meta-networks for few-shot regression with those trained with more training data. This allows our final network to capture a notion of model dynamics; that predicts how model parameters are likely to change as more training data is gradually added. We demonstrate results on image classification datasets (SUN; Places; and ImageNet) tuned for the long-tailed setting; that significantly outperform common heuristics; such as data resampling or reweighting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7278-learning-to-model-the-tail/bibtex,Yu-Xiong Wang; Deva Ramanan; Martial Hebert

A number of recent papers provided convergence rate estimates for their deterministic (cyclic) and randomized variants that differ in the selection of update coordinates. These estimates suggest randomized coordinate descent (RCD) performs better than cyclic coordinate descent (CCD); although numerical experiments do not provide clear justification for this comparison. In this paper; we provide examples and more generally problem classes for which CCD (or CD with any deterministic order) is faster than RCD in terms of asymptotic worst-case convergence. Furthermore; we provide lower and upper bounds on the amount of improvement on the rate of CCD relative to RCD; which depends on the deterministic order used. We also provide a characterization of the best deterministic order (that leads to the maximum improvement in convergence rate) in terms of the combinatorial properties of the Hessian matrix of the objective function.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7275-when-cyclic-coordinate-descent-outperforms-randomized-coordinate-descent/bibtex,Mert Gurbuzbalaban; Asuman Ozdaglar; Pablo A.

2017,Active Learning from Peers,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7276-active-learning-from-peers.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7276-active-learning-from-peers,This paper addresses the challenge of learning from peers in an online multitask setting. Instead of always requesting a label from a human oracle; the proposed method first determines if the learner for each task can acquire that label with sufficient confidence from its peers either as a task-similarity weighted sum; or from the single most similar task.  If so; it saves the oracle query for later use in more difficult cases; and if not it queries the human oracle.  The paper develops the new algorithm to exhibit this behavior and proves a theoretical mistake bound for the method compared to the best linear predictor in hindsight. Experiments over three multitask learning benchmark datasets show clearly superior performance over baselines such as assuming task independence; learning only from the oracle and not learning from peer tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7276-active-learning-from-peers/bibtex,Keerthiram Murugesan; Jaime Carbonell

We derive the convergence rate depending on the mixing coefficients; minimum and maximum pairwise distances between the true centers; dimensionality and number of components; and obtain a near-optimal local contraction radius. While there have been some recent notable works that derive local convergence rates for EM in the two symmetric mixture of Gaussians; in the more general case; the derivations need structurally different and non-trivial arguments. We use recent tools from learning theory and empirical processes to achieve our theoretical results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7271-convergence-of-gradient-em-on-multi-component-mixture-of-gaussians/bibtex,Bowei Yan; Mingzhang Yin; Purnamrita Sarkar

We train a masking model to manipulate the scores of the classifier by masking salient parts of the input image. Our model generalises well to unseen images and requires a single forward pass to perform saliency detection; therefore suitable for use in real-time systems. We test our approach on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and show that the produced saliency maps are easily interpretable; sharp; and free of artifacts. We suggest a new metric for saliency and test our method on the ImageNet object localisation task. We achieve results outperforming other weakly supervised methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7272-real-time-image-saliency-for-black-box-classifiers/bibtex,Piotr Dabkowski; Yarin Gal

2017,Efficient Approximation Algorithms for Strings Kernel Based Sequence Classification,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7269-efficient-approximation-algorithms-for-strings-kernel-based-sequence-classification.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7269-efficient-approximation-algorithms-for-strings-kernel-based-sequence-classification,Sequence classification algorithms; such as SVM; require a definition of distance (similarity) measure between two sequences. A commonly used notion of similarity is the number of matches between k-mers (k-length subsequences) in the two sequences. Extending this definition; by considering two k-mers to match if their distance is at most m; yields better classification performance. This; however; makes the problem computationally much more complex. Known algorithms to compute this similarity have computational complexity that render them applicable only for small values of k and m. In this work; we develop novel techniques to efficiently and accurately estimate the pairwise similarity score; which enables us to use much larger values of k and m; and get higher predictive accuracy. This opens up a broad avenue of applying this classification approach to audio; images; and text sequences. Our algorithm achieves excellent approximation performance with theoretical guarantees. In the process we solve an open combinatorial problem; which was posed as a major hindrance to the scalability of existing solutions. We give analytical bounds on quality and runtime of our algorithm and report its empirical performance on real world biological and music sequences datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7269-efficient-approximation-algorithms-for-strings-kernel-based-sequence-classification/bibtex,Muhammad Farhan; Juvaria Tariq; Arif Zaman; Mudassir Shabbir; Imdad Ullah Khan

Specifically; we remove a part of the total derivative with respect to the variational parameters that corresponds to the score function. Removing this term produces an unbiased gradient estimator whose variance approaches zero as the approximate posterior approaches the exact posterior. We analyze the behavior of this gradient estimator theoretically and empirically; and generalize it to more complex variational distributions such as mixtures and importance-weighted posteriors.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7268-sticking-the-landing-simple-lower-variance-gradient-estimators-for-variational-inference/bibtex,Geoffrey Roeder; Yuhuai Wu; David K.

2017,Predicting Scene Parsing and Motion Dynamics in the Future,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7267-predicting-scene-parsing-and-motion-dynamics-in-the-future.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7267-predicting-scene-parsing-and-motion-dynamics-in-the-future,It is important for intelligent systems; e.g. autonomous vehicles and robotics to anticipate the future in order to plan early and make decisions accordingly. Predicting the future scene parsing and motion dynamics helps the agents better understand the visual environment better as the former provides dense semantic segmentations; i.e. what objects will be present and where they will appear; while the latter provides dense motion information; i.e. how the objects move in the future. In this paper; we propose a novel model to predict the scene parsing and motion dynamics in unobserved future video frames simultaneously. Using history information (preceding frames and corresponding scene parsing results) as input; our model is able to predict the scene parsing and motion for arbitrary time steps ahead. More importantly; our model is superior compared to other methods that predict parsing and motion separately; as the complementary relationship between the two tasks are fully utilized in our model through joint learning. To our best knowledge; this is the first attempt in jointly predicting scene parsing and motion dynamics in the future frames. On the large-scale Cityscapes dataset; it is demonstrated that our model produces significantly better parsing and motion prediction results compared to well established baselines. In addition; we also show our model can be used to predict the steering angle of the vehicles; which further verifies the ability of our model to learn underlying latent parameters.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7267-predicting-scene-parsing-and-motion-dynamics-in-the-future/bibtex,Xiaojie Jin; Huaxin Xiao; Xiaohui Shen; Jimei Yang; Zhe Lin; Yunpeng Chen; Zequn Jie; Jiashi Feng; Shuicheng Yan
2017,Linear Time Computation of Moments in Sum-Product Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7265-linear-time-computation-of-moments-in-sum-product-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7265-linear-time-computation-of-moments-in-sum-product-networks,Bayesian online algorithms for Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) need to update their posterior distribution after seeing one single additional instance. To do so; they must compute moments of the model parameters under this distribution. The best existing method for computing such moments scales quadratically in the size of the SPN; although it scales linearly for trees. This unfortunate scaling makes Bayesian online algorithms prohibitively expensive; except for small or tree-structured SPNs. We propose an optimal linear-time algorithm that works even when the SPN is a general directed acyclic graph (DAG); which significantly broadens the applicability of Bayesian online algorithms for SPNs. There are three key ingredients in the design and analysis of our algorithm: 1). For each edge in the graph; we construct a linear time reduction from the moment computation problem to a joint inference problem in SPNs. 2). Using the property that each SPN computes a multilinear polynomial; we give an efficient procedure for polynomial evaluation by differentiation without expanding the network that may contain exponentially many monomials. 3). We propose a dynamic programming method to further reduce the computation of the moments of all the edges in the graph from quadratic to linear. We demonstrate the usefulness of our linear time algorithm by applying it to develop a linear time assume density filter (ADF) for SPNs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7265-linear-time-computation-of-moments-in-sum-product-networks/bibtex,Han Zhao; Geoffrey J.

This rate is seen to be suboptimal (compared to the minimax rate) by only a factor of $\log\log{n}$. Our proof technique is centered around a novel construction that we call a lower interpolant. We extend our results to misspecified models and exponential family distributions. We also describe the implications of our error analysis for the approximate screening of changepoints.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7264-a-sharp-error-analysis-for-the-fused-lasso-with-application-to-approximate-changepoint-screening/bibtex,Kevin Lin; James L.

Item cold-start problems are particularly acute in settings such as Tweet recommendation where new items arrive continuously. In this paper; we present a meta-learning strategy to address item cold-start when new items arrive continuously. We propose two deep neural network architectures that implement our meta-learning strategy. The first architecture learns a linear classifier whose weights are determined by the item history while the second architecture learns a neural network whose biases are instead adjusted. We evaluate our techniques on the real-world problem of Tweet recommendation. On production data at Twitter; we demonstrate that our proposed techniques significantly beat the MF baseline and also outperform production models for Tweet recommendation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7266-a-meta-learning-perspective-on-cold-start-recommendations-for-items/bibtex,Manasi Vartak; Arvind Thiagarajan; Conrado Miranda; Jeshua Bratman; Hugo Larochelle

In particular; identifying a good hierarchical structure is at the same time a fundamental and challenging problem for several applications. The amount of data to analyze is increasing at an astonishing rate each day. Hence there is a need for new solutions to efficiently compute effective hierarchical clusterings on such huge data.  The main focus of this paper is on minimum spanning tree (MST) based clusterings. In particular; we propose affinity; a novel hierarchical clustering based on Boruvka's MST algorithm. We prove certain theoretical guarantees for affinity (as well as some other classic algorithms) and show that in practice it is superior to several other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.   Furthermore; we present two MapReduce implementations for affinity. The first one works for the case where the input graph is dense and takes constant rounds. It is based on a Massively Parallel MST algorithm for dense graphs that improves upon the state-of-the-art algorithm of Lattanzi et al. (SPAA 2011). Our second algorithm has no assumption on the density of the input graph and finds the affinity clustering in $O(\log n)$ rounds using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs). We show experimentally that our algorithms are scalable for huge data sets; e.g.; for graphs with trillions of edges.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7262-affinity-clustering-hierarchical-clustering-at-scale/bibtex,Mohammadhossein Bateni; Soheil Behnezhad; Mahsa Derakhshan; MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi; Raimondas Kiveris; Silvio Lattanzi; Vahab Mirrokni

This is an instance of a broad family of problems including machine translation; decipherment; and sentiment modification. The key challenge is to separate the content from other aspects such as style. We assume a shared latent content distribution across different text corpora; and propose a method that leverages refined alignment of latent representations to perform style transfer. The transferred sentences from one style should match example sentences from the other style as a population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this cross-alignment method on three tasks: sentiment modification; decipherment of word substitution ciphers; and recovery of word order.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7259-style-transfer-from-non-parallel-text-by-cross-alignment/bibtex,Tianxiao Shen; Tao Lei; Regina Barzilay; Tommi Jaakkola

We propose an unsupervised approach to learn such transformations by attempting to reconstruct an image from a linear combination of transformations of its nearest neighbors.  On handwritten digits and celebrity portraits; we show that even with linear transformations; our method generates visually high-quality modified images.  Moreover; since our method is semiparametric and does not model the data distribution; the learned transformations extrapolate off the training data and can be applied to new types of images.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7263-unsupervised-transformation-learning-via-convex-relaxations/bibtex,Tatsunori B.

2017,Stochastic Submodular Maximization: The Case of Coverage Functions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7261-stochastic-submodular-maximization-the-case-of-coverage-functions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7261-stochastic-submodular-maximization-the-case-of-coverage-functions,Stochastic optimization of continuous objectives is at the heart of modern machine learning. However; many important problems are of discrete nature and often involve submodular objectives. We seek to unleash the power of stochastic continuous optimization; namely stochastic gradient descent and its variants; to such discrete problems. We first introduce the problem of stochastic submodular optimization; where one needs to optimize a submodular objective which is given as an expectation. Our model captures situations where the discrete objective arises as an empirical risk (e.g.; in the case of exemplar-based clustering); or is given as an explicit stochastic model (e.g.; in the case of influence maximization in social networks). By exploiting that common extensions act linearly on the class of submodular functions; we employ projected stochastic gradient ascent and its variants in the continuous domain; and perform rounding to obtain discrete solutions. We focus on the rich and widely used family of weighted coverage functions. We show that our approach yields solutions that are guaranteed to match the optimal approximation guarantees; while reducing the computational cost by several orders of magnitude; as we demonstrate empirically.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7261-stochastic-submodular-maximization-the-case-of-coverage-functions/bibtex,Mohammad Karimi; Mario Lucic; Hamed Hassani; Andreas Krause

Building on an averaging formulation of accelerated mirror descent; we propose a stochastic variant in which the gradient is contaminated by noise; and study the resulting stochastic differential equation. We prove a bound on the rate of change of an energy function associated with the problem; then use it to derive estimates of convergence rates of the function values (almost surely and in expectation); both for persistent and asymptotically vanishing noise. We discuss the interaction between the parameters of the dynamics (learning rate and averaging rates) and the covariation of the noise process. In particular; we show how the asymptotic rate of covariation affects the choice of parameters and; ultimately; the convergence rate.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7256-acceleration-and-averaging-in-stochastic-descent-dynamics/bibtex,Walid Krichene; Peter L.

Both tasks take as input the raw image and a binary mask representing a candidate object. For the error detection task; the desired output is a map of split and merge errors in the object. For the error correction task; the desired output is the true object. We call this object mask pruning; because the candidate object mask is assumed to be a superset of the true object. We train multiscale 3D convolutional networks to perform both tasks. We find that the error-detecting net can achieve high accuracy. The accuracy of the error-correcting net is enhanced if its input object mask is ``advice'' (union of erroneous objects) from the error-detecting net.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7258-an-error-detection-and-correction-framework-for-connectomics/bibtex,Jonathan Zung; Ignacio Tartavull; Kisuk Lee; H.

2017,Cross-Spectral Factor Analysis,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7260-cross-spectral-factor-analysis.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7260-cross-spectral-factor-analysis,In neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or depression; there is often a disruption in the way that regions of the brain synchronize with one another. To facilitate understanding of network-level synchronization between brain regions; we introduce a novel model of multisite low-frequency neural recordings; such as local field potentials (LFPs) and electroencephalograms (EEGs). The proposed model; named Cross-Spectral Factor Analysis (CSFA); breaks the observed signal into factors defined by unique spatio-spectral properties. These properties are granted to the factors via a Gaussian process formulation in a multiple kernel learning framework. In this way; the LFP signals can be mapped to a lower dimensional space in a way that retains information of relevance to neuroscientists.  Critically; the factors are interpretable. The proposed approach empirically allows similar performance in classifying mouse genotype and behavioral context when compared to commonly used approaches that lack the interpretability of CSFA. We also introduce a semi-supervised approach; termed discriminative CSFA (dCSFA). CSFA and dCSFA provide useful tools for understanding neural dynamics; particularly by aiding in the design of causal follow-up experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7260-cross-spectral-factor-analysis/bibtex,Neil Gallagher; Kyle R.

While previous approaches construct a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding of the data set that reflects the given similarity triplets; we aim at defining kernel functions that correspond to high-dimensional embeddings. These kernel functions can subsequently be used to apply any kernel method to the data set.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7257-kernel-functions-based-on-triplet-comparisons/bibtex,Matth?us Kleindessner; Ulrike von Luxburg
2017,Attend and Predict: Understanding Gene Regulation by Selective Attention on Chromatin,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7255-attend-and-predict-understanding-gene-regulation-by-selective-attention-on-chromatin.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7255-attend-and-predict-understanding-gene-regulation-by-selective-attention-on-chromatin,The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enabled a flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks.  Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements.  Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured; high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what are the relevant factors and how they work together.  Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach; AttentiveChrome; that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction; enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate; but its attention scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency map.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7255-attend-and-predict-understanding-gene-regulation-by-selective-attention-on-chromatin/bibtex,Ritambhara Singh; Jack Lanchantin; Arshdeep Sekhon; Yanjun Qi
2017,Structured Bayesian Pruning via Log-Normal Multiplicative Noise,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7254-structured-bayesian-pruning-via-log-normal-multiplicative-noise.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7254-structured-bayesian-pruning-via-log-normal-multiplicative-noise,Dropout-based regularization methods can be regarded as injecting random noise with pre-defined magnitude to different parts of the neural network during training. It was recently shown that Bayesian dropout procedure not only improves gener- alization but also leads to extremely sparse neural architectures by automatically setting the individual noise magnitude per weight. However; this sparsity can hardly be used for acceleration since it is unstructured. In the paper; we propose a new Bayesian model that takes into account the computational structure of neural net- works and provides structured sparsity; e.g. removes neurons and/or convolutional channels in CNNs. To do this we inject noise to the neurons outputs while keeping the weights unregularized. We establish the probabilistic model with a proper truncated log-uniform prior over the noise and truncated log-normal variational approximation that ensures that the KL-term in the evidence lower bound is com- puted in closed-form. The model leads to structured sparsity by removing elements with a low SNR from the computation graph and provides significant acceleration on a number of deep neural architectures. The model is easy to implement as it can be formulated as a separate dropout-like layer.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7254-structured-bayesian-pruning-via-log-normal-multiplicative-noise/bibtex,Kirill Neklyudov; Dmitry Molchanov; Arsenii Ashukha; Dmitry P.

2017,Inverse Reward Design,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7253-inverse-reward-design.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7253-inverse-reward-design,Autonomous agents optimize the reward function we give them. What they don't know is how hard it is for us to design a reward function that actually captures what we  want. When designing the reward; we might think of some specific training scenarios; and make sure that the reward will lead to the right behavior in those scenarios. Inevitably; agents encounter new scenarios (e.g.; new types of terrain) where optimizing that same reward may lead to undesired behavior. Our insight is that reward functions are merely observations about what the designer actually wants; and that they should be interpreted in the context in which they were designed. We introduce inverse reward design (IRD) as the problem of inferring the true objective based on the designed reward and the training MDP. We introduce approximate methods for solving IRD problems; and use their solution to plan risk-averse behavior in test MDPs. Empirical results suggest that this approach can help alleviate negative side effects of misspecified reward functions and mitigate reward hacking.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7253-inverse-reward-design/bibtex,Dylan Hadfield-Menell; Smitha Milli; Pieter Abbeel; Stuart J.

Some event types are stochastically excited or inhibited?in the sense of having their probabilities elevated or decreased?by patterns in the sequence of previous events. Discovering such patterns can help us predict which type of event will happen next and when. We model streams of discrete events in continuous time; by constructing a neurally self-modulating multivariate point process in which the intensities of multiple event types evolve according to a novel continuous-time LSTM. This generative model allows past events to influence the future in complex and realistic ways; by conditioning future event intensities on the hidden state of a recurrent neural network that has consumed the stream of past events. Our model has desirable qualitative properties. It achieves competitive likelihood and predictive accuracy on real and synthetic datasets; including under missing-data conditions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7252-the-neural-hawkes-process-a-neurally-self-modulating-multivariate-point-process/bibtex,Hongyuan Mei; Jason M.

2017,Subspace Clustering via Tangent Cones,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7251-subspace-clustering-via-tangent-cones.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7251-subspace-clustering-via-tangent-cones,Given samples lying on any of a number of subspaces; subspace clustering is the task of grouping the samples based on the their corresponding subspaces. Many subspace clustering methods operate by assigning a measure of affinity to each pair of points and feeding these affinities into a graph clustering algorithm. This paper proposes a new paradigm for subspace clustering that computes affinities based on the corresponding conic geometry. The proposed conic subspace clustering (CSC) approach considers the convex hull of a collection of normalized data points and the corresponding tangent cones. The union of subspaces underlying the data imposes a strong association between the tangent cone at a sample $x$ and the original subspace containing $x$. In addition to describing this novel geometric perspective; this paper provides a practical algorithm for subspace clustering that leverages this perspective; where a tangent cone membership test is used to estimate the affinities. This algorithm is accompanied with deterministic and stochastic guarantees on the properties of the learned affinity matrix; on the true and false positive rates and spread; which directly translate into the overall clustering accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7251-subspace-clustering-via-tangent-cones/bibtex,Amin Jalali; Rebecca Willett

Our model consists of recurrent neural modules that send features through a routing center; endowing the modules with the flexibility to share features over multiple time steps. We show that our model learns to route information hierarchically; processing input data by a chain of modules. We observe common architectures; such as feed forward neural networks and skip connections; emerging as special cases of our architecture; while novel connectivity patterns are learned for the text8 compression task. Our model outperforms standard recurrent neural networks on several sequential benchmarks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7249-learning-hierarchical-information-flow-with-recurrent-neural-modules/bibtex,Danijar Hafner; Alexander Irpan; James Davidson; Nicolas Heess

Here; we propose black-box learning and inference algorithms for undirected models that optimize a variational approximation to the log-likelihood of the model. Central to our approach is an upper bound on the log-partition function parametrized by a function q that we express as a flexible neural network. Our bound makes it possible to track the partition function during learning; to speed-up sampling; and to train a broad class of hybrid directed/undirected models via a unified variational inference framework. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several popular generative modeling datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7250-neural-variational-inference-and-learning-in-undirected-graphical-models/bibtex,Volodymyr Kuleshov; Stefano Ermon
2017,Neural Expectation Maximization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7246-neural-expectation-maximization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7246-neural-expectation-maximization,Many real world tasks such as reasoning and physical interaction require identification and manipulation of conceptual entities. A first step towards solving these tasks is the automated discovery of distributed symbol-like representations. In this paper; we explicitly formalize this problem as inference in a spatial mixture model where each component is parametrized by a neural network.  Based on the Expectation Maximization framework we then derive a differentiable clustering method that simultaneously learns how to group and represent individual entities.  We evaluate our method on the (sequential) perceptual grouping task and find that it is able to accurately recover the constituent objects.  We demonstrate that the learned representations are useful for next-step prediction.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7246-neural-expectation-maximization/bibtex,Klaus Greff; Sjoerd van Steenkiste; J?rgen Schmidhuber
2017,Z-Forcing: Training Stochastic Recurrent Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7248-z-forcing-training-stochastic-recurrent-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7248-z-forcing-training-stochastic-recurrent-networks,Many efforts have been devoted to training generative latent variable models with autoregressive decoders; such as recurrent neural networks (RNN). Stochastic recurrent models have been successful in capturing the variability observed in natural sequential data such as speech. We unify successful ideas from recently proposed architectures into a stochastic recurrent model: each step in the sequence is associated with a latent variable that is used to condition the recurrent dynamics for future steps. Training is performed with amortised variational inference where the approximate posterior is augmented with a RNN that runs backward through the sequence. In addition to maximizing the variational lower bound; we ease training of the latent variables by adding an auxiliary cost which forces them to reconstruct the state of the backward recurrent network. This provides the latent variables with a task-independent objective that enhances the performance of the overall model. We found this strategy to perform better than alternative approaches such as KL annealing. Although being conceptually simple; our model achieves state-of-the-art results on standard speech benchmarks such as TIMIT and Blizzard and competitive performance on sequential MNIST. Finally; we apply our model to language modeling on the IMDB dataset where the auxiliary cost helps in learning interpretable latent variables.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7248-z-forcing-training-stochastic-recurrent-networks/bibtex,Anirudh Goyal ALIAS PARTH GOYAL; Alessandro Sordoni; Marc-Alexandre C?t?; Nan Ke; Yoshua Bengio
2017,Few-Shot Adversarial Domain Adaptation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7244-few-shot-adversarial-domain-adaptation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7244-few-shot-adversarial-domain-adaptation,This work provides a framework for addressing the problem of supervised domain adaptation with deep models. The main idea is to exploit adversarial learning to learn an embedded subspace that simultaneously maximizes the confusion between two domains while semantically aligning their embedding. The supervised setting becomes attractive especially when there are only a few target data samples that need to be labeled. In this few-shot learning scenario; alignment and separation of semantic probability distributions is difficult because of the lack of data. We found that by carefully designing a training scheme whereby the typical binary adversarial discriminator is augmented to distinguish between four different classes; it is possible to effectively address the supervised adaptation problem. In addition; the approach has a high ?speed? of adaptation; i.e. it requires an extremely low number of labeled target training samples; even one per category can be effective. We then extensively compare this approach to the state of the art in domain adaptation in two experiments: one using datasets for handwritten digit recognition; and one using datasets for visual object recognition.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7244-few-shot-adversarial-domain-adaptation/bibtex,Saeid Motiian; Quinn Jones; Seyed Iranmanesh; Gianfranco Doretto
2017,The power of absolute discounting: all-dimensional distribution estimation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7243-the-power-of-absolute-discounting-all-dimensional-distribution-estimation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7243-the-power-of-absolute-discounting-all-dimensional-distribution-estimation,Categorical models are a natural fit for many problems. When learning the distribution of categories from samples; high-dimensionality may dilute the data. Minimax optimality is too pessimistic to remedy this issue. A serendipitously discovered estimator; absolute discounting; corrects empirical frequencies by subtracting a constant from observed categories; which it then redistributes among the unobserved. It outperforms classical estimators empirically; and has been used extensively in natural language modeling. In this paper; we rigorously explain the prowess of this estimator using less pessimistic notions. We show  that (1) absolute discounting recovers classical minimax KL-risk rates; (2) it is \emph{adaptive} to an effective dimension rather than the true dimension; (3) it is strongly related to the Good-Turing estimator and inherits its \emph{competitive} properties. We use power-law distributions as the cornerstone of these results. We validate the theory via synthetic data and an application to the Global Terrorism Database.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7243-the-power-of-absolute-discounting-all-dimensional-distribution-estimation/bibtex,Moein Falahatgar; Mesrob I.

We circumvent the non-convex optimization problem using improper learning: carefully overparameterize the class of LDSs by a polylogarithmic factor; in exchange for convexity of the loss functions. From this arises a polynomial-time algorithm with a near-optimal regret guarantee; with an analogous sample complexity bound for agnostic learning. Our algorithm is based on a novel filtering technique; which may be of independent interest: we convolve the time series with the eigenvectors of a certain Hankel matrix.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7247-learning-linear-dynamical-systems-via-spectral-filtering/bibtex,Elad Hazan; Karan Singh; Cyril Zhang
2017,Spectral Mixture Kernels for Multi-Output Gaussian Processes,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7245-spectral-mixture-kernels-for-multi-output-gaussian-processes.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7245-spectral-mixture-kernels-for-multi-output-gaussian-processes,Early approaches to multiple-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) relied on linear combinations of independent; latent; single-output Gaussian processes (GPs). This resulted in cross-covariance functions with limited parametric interpretation; thus conflicting with the ability  of single-output GPs to understand lengthscales; frequencies and magnitudes to name a few. On the contrary; current approaches to MOGP are able to better interpret the relationship between different channels by directly modelling the cross-covariances as a spectral mixture kernel with a phase shift. We extend this rationale and propose a parametric family of complex-valued cross-spectral densities and then build on Cram?r's Theorem (the multivariate version of Bochner's Theorem) to provide a principled approach to design multivariate covariance functions. The so-constructed kernels are able to model delays among channels in addition to phase differences and are thus more expressive than previous methods; while also providing full parametric interpretation of the relationship across channels. The proposed method is first validated on synthetic data and then compared to existing MOGP methods on two real-world examples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7245-spectral-mixture-kernels-for-multi-output-gaussian-processes/bibtex,Gabriel Parra; Felipe Tobar
2017,The Scaling Limit of High-Dimensional Online Independent Component Analysis,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7241-the-scaling-limit-of-high-dimensional-online-independent-component-analysis.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7241-the-scaling-limit-of-high-dimensional-online-independent-component-analysis,We analyze the dynamics of an online algorithm for independent component analysis in the high-dimensional scaling limit. As the ambient dimension tends to infinity; and with proper time scaling; we show that the time-varying joint empirical measure of the target feature vector and the estimates provided by the algorithm will converge weakly to a deterministic measured-valued process that can be characterized as the unique solution of a nonlinear PDE. Numerical solutions of this PDE; which involves two spatial variables and one time variable; can be efficiently obtained. These solutions provide detailed information about the performance of the ICA algorithm; as many practical performance metrics are functionals of the joint empirical measures. Numerical simulations show that our asymptotic analysis is accurate even for moderate dimensions. In addition to providing a tool for understanding the performance of the algorithm; our PDE analysis also provides useful insight. In particular; in the high-dimensional limit; the original coupled dynamics associated with the algorithm will be asymptotically ?decoupled?; with each coordinate independently solving a 1-D effective minimization problem via stochastic gradient descent. Exploiting this insight to design new algorithms for achieving optimal trade-offs between computational and statistical efficiency may prove an interesting line of future research.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7241-the-scaling-limit-of-high-dimensional-online-independent-component-analysis/bibtex,Chuang Wang; Yue Lu
2017,Approximation Algorithms for \ell_0-Low Rank Approximation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7242-approximation-algorithms-for-ell_0-low-rank-approximation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7242-approximation-algorithms-for-ell_0-low-rank-approximation,We study the $\ell_0$-Low Rank Approximation Problem; where the goal is;    given an $m \times n$ matrix $A$; to output a rank-$k$ matrix $A'$ for which   $\|A'-A\|_0$ is minimized.    Here; for a matrix $B$; $\|B\|_0$ denotes the number of its non-zero entries.    This NP-hard variant of low rank approximation is natural for problems    with no underlying metric; and its goal is to minimize the number of disagreeing   data positions.      We provide approximation algorithms which significantly improve the running time    and approximation factor of previous work.    For $k > 1$; we show how to find; in poly$(mn)$ time for every $k$;    a rank $O(k \log(n/k))$ matrix $A'$ for which $\|A'-A\|_0 \leq O(k^2 \log(n/k)) \OPT$.    To the best of our knowledge; this is the first algorithm with provable guarantees    for the $\ell_0$-Low Rank Approximation Problem for $k > 1$;    even for bicriteria algorithms.       For the well-studied case when $k = 1$; we give a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation    in {\it sublinear time}; which is impossible for other variants of low rank    approximation such as for the  Frobenius norm.    We strengthen this for the well-studied case of binary matrices to obtain    a $(1+O(\psi))$-approximation in sublinear time;    where $\psi = \OPT/\nnz{A}$.   For small $\psi$; our approximation factor is $1+o(1)$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7242-approximation-algorithms-for-ell_0-low-rank-approximation/bibtex,Karl Bringmann; Pavel Kolev; David Woodruff
2017,Practical Hash Functions for Similarity Estimation and Dimensionality Reduction,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7239-practical-hash-functions-for-similarity-estimation-and-dimensionality-reduction.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7239-practical-hash-functions-for-similarity-estimation-and-dimensionality-reduction,Hashing is a basic tool for dimensionality reduction employed in several aspects of machine learning. However; the perfomance analysis is often carried out under the abstract assumption that a truly random unit cost hash function is used; without concern for which concrete hash function is employed. The concrete hash function may work fine on sufficiently random input. The question is if it can be trusted in the real world when faced with more structured input.  In this paper we focus on two prominent applications of hashing; namely similarity estimation with the one permutation hashing (OPH) scheme of Li et al. [NIPS'12] and feature hashing (FH) of Weinberger et al. [ICML'09]; both of which have found numerous applications; i.e. in approximate near-neighbour search with LSH and large-scale classification with SVM.      We consider the recent mixed tabulation hash function of Dahlgaard et al. [FOCS'15] which was proved theoretically to perform like a truly random hash function in many applications; including the above OPH. Here we first show improved concentration bounds for FH with truly random hashing and then argue that mixed tabulation performs similar when the input vectors are sparse. Our main contribution; however; is an experimental comparison of different hashing schemes when used inside FH; OPH; and LSH.  We find that mixed tabulation hashing is almost as fast as the classic multiply-mod-prime scheme ax+b mod p. Mutiply-mod-prime is guaranteed to work well on sufficiently random data; but we demonstrate that in the above applications; it can lead to bias and poor concentration on both real-world and synthetic data. We also compare with the very popular MurmurHash3; which has no proven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to truly random hashing in our experiments. However; mixed tabulation was 40% faster than MurmurHash3; and it has the proven guarantee of good performance on all possible input making it more reliable.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7239-practical-hash-functions-for-similarity-estimation-and-dimensionality-reduction/bibtex,S?ren Dahlgaard; Mathias Knudsen; Mikkel Thorup

However; the convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions. TTUR has an individual learning rate for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic approximation; we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular Adam optimization; for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation; we introduce the `Fr?chet Inception Distance'' (FID) which captures the similarity of generated images to real ones better than the Inception Score.

2017,Learning Mixture of Gaussians with Streaming Data,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7238-learning-mixture-of-gaussians-with-streaming-data.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7238-learning-mixture-of-gaussians-with-streaming-data,In this paper; we study the problem of learning a mixture of Gaussians with streaming data: given a stream of $N$ points in $d$ dimensions generated by an unknown mixture of $k$ spherical Gaussians; the goal is to estimate the model parameters using a single pass over the data stream. We analyze a streaming version of the popular Lloyd's heuristic and show that the algorithm estimates all the unknown centers of the component Gaussians  accurately if they are sufficiently separated. Assuming each pair of centers are $C\sigma$ distant with $C=\Omega((k\log k)^{1/4}\sigma)$ and where $\sigma^2$ is the maximum variance of any Gaussian component; we show that asymptotically the algorithm estimates the centers optimally (up to certain constants); our center separation requirement matches the best known result for spherical Gaussians \citep{vempalawang}. For finite samples; we show that a bias term based on the initial estimate decreases at $O(1/{\rm poly}(N))$ rate while variance decreases at nearly optimal rate of $\sigma^2 d/N$. Our analysis requires seeding the algorithm with a good initial estimate of the true cluster centers for which we provide an online PCA based clustering algorithm. Indeed; the asymptotic per-step time complexity of our algorithm is the optimal $d\cdot k$ while space complexity of our algorithm is $O(dk\log k)$.  In addition to the bias and variance terms which tend to $0$; the hard-thresholding based updates of streaming Lloyd's algorithm is agnostic to the data distribution and hence incurs an \emph{approximation error} that cannot be avoided. However; by using a streaming version of the classical \emph{(soft-thresholding-based)} EM method that exploits the Gaussian distribution explicitly; we show that for a mixture of two Gaussians the true means can be estimated consistently; with estimation error decreasing at nearly optimal rate; and tending to $0$ for $N\rightarrow \infty$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7238-learning-mixture-of-gaussians-with-streaming-data/bibtex,Aditi Raghunathan; Prateek Jain; Ravishankar Krishnawamy
2017,Filtering Variational Objectives,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7235-filtering-variational-objectives.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7235-filtering-variational-objectives,When used as a surrogate objective for maximum likelihood estimation in latent variable models; the evidence lower bound (ELBO) produces state-of-the-art results. Inspired by this; we consider the extension of the ELBO to a family of lower bounds defined by a particle filter's estimator of the marginal likelihood; the filtering variational objectives (FIVOs). FIVOs take the same arguments as the ELBO; but can exploit a model's sequential structure to form tighter bounds. We present results that relate the tightness of FIVO's bound to the variance of the particle filter's estimator by considering the generic case of bounds defined as log-transformed likelihood estimators. Experimentally; we show that training with FIVO results in substantial improvements over training the same model architecture with the ELBO on sequential data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7235-filtering-variational-objectives/bibtex,Chris J.

2017,Random Projection Filter Bank for Time Series Data,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7234-random-projection-filter-bank-for-time-series-data.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7234-random-projection-filter-bank-for-time-series-data,We propose Random Projection Filter Bank (RPFB) as a generic and simple approach to extract features from time series data. RPFB is a set of randomly generated stable autoregressive filters that are convolved with the input time series to generate the features. These features can be used by any conventional machine learning algorithm for solving tasks such as time series prediction; classification with time series data; etc. Different filters in RPFB extract different aspects of the time series; and together they provide a reasonably good summary of the time series. RPFB is easy to implement; fast to compute; and parallelizable. We provide an error upper bound indicating that RPFB provides a reasonable approximation to a class of dynamical systems. The empirical results in a series of synthetic and real-world problems show that RPFB is an effective method to extract features from time series.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7234-random-projection-filter-bank-for-time-series-data/bibtex,Amir-massoud Farahmand; Sepideh Pourazarm; Daniel Nikovski
2017,Towards Generalization and Simplicity in Continuous Control,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7233-towards-generalization-and-simplicity-in-continuous-control.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7233-towards-generalization-and-simplicity-in-continuous-control,The remarkable successes of deep learning in speech recognition and computer vision have motivated efforts to adapt similar techniques to other problem domains; including reinforcement learning (RL). Consequently; RL methods have produced rich motor behaviors on simulated robot tasks; with their success largely attributed to the use of multi-layer neural networks. This work is among the first to carefully study what might be responsible for these recent advancements. Our main result calls this emerging narrative into question by showing that much simpler architectures -- based on linear and RBF parameterizations  -- achieve comparable performance to state of the art results.  We not only study different policy representations with regard to performance measures at hand; but also towards robustness to external perturbations. We again find that the learned neural network policies --- under the standard training scenarios ---  are no more robust than linear (or RBF) policies; in fact; all three are remarkably brittle. Finally; we then directly modify the training scenarios in order to favor more robust policies; and we again do not find a compelling case to favor multi-layer architectures.  Overall; this study suggests that multi-layer architectures should not be the default choice; unless a side-by-side comparison to simpler architectures shows otherwise. More generally; we hope that these results lead to more interest in carefully studying the architectural choices; and associated trade-offs; for training generalizable and robust policies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7233-towards-generalization-and-simplicity-in-continuous-control/bibtex,Aravind Rajeswaran; Kendall Lowrey; Emanuel V.

Solid harmonic wavelets are computed by multiplying solid  harmonic functions with Gaussian windows dilated at different scales. Invariant  scattering coefficients are obtained by cascading such wavelet transforms with  the complex modulus nonlinearity. We study an application of solid harmonic  scattering invariants to the estimation of quantum molecular energies; which  are also invariant to rigid motion and stable with respect to deformations. A multilinear regression  over scattering invariants provides close to state of the art results over  small and large databases of organic molecules.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7232-solid-harmonic-wavelet-scattering-predicting-quantum-molecular-energy-from-invariant-descriptors-of-3d-electronic-densities/bibtex,Michael Eickenberg; Georgios Exarchakis; Matthew Hirn; Stephane Mallat

Our methods are based on a novel combination of compressed sensing and graph coloring techniques; and provably exploit structural prior knowledge about the Jacobian such as sparsity and symmetry while being noise robust. We demonstrate efficient backpropagation through noisy blackbox layers in a deep neural net; improved data-efficiency in the task of linearizing the dynamics of a rigid body system; and the generic ability to handle a rich class of input-output dependency structures in Jacobian estimation problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7230-on-blackbox-backpropagation-and-jacobian-sensing/bibtex,Krzysztof M.

While the k-means objective is NP-hard in the worst-case; practitioners have enjoyed remarkable success in applying heuristics like Lloyd's algorithm for this problem. To address this disconnect; we study the following question: what properties of real-world instances will enable us to design efficient algorithms and prove guarantees for finding the optimal clustering?   We consider a natural notion called additive perturbation stability that we believe captures many practical instances of Euclidean k-means clustering. Stable instances have unique optimal k-means solutions that does not change even when each point is perturbed a little (in Euclidean distance). This captures the property that k-means optimal solution should be tolerant to measurement errors and uncertainty in the points. We design efficient algorithms that provably recover the optimal clustering for instances that are additive perturbation stable. When the instance has some additional separation; we can design a simple; efficient algorithm with provable guarantees that is also robust to outliers. We also complement these results by studying the amount of stability in real datasets; and demonstrating that our algorithm performs well on these benchmark datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7228-clustering-stable-instances-of-euclidean-k-means/bibtex,Aravindan Vijayaraghavan; Abhratanu Dutta; Alex Wang

By performing convolution over a local neighborhood of a node of interest; we are able to stack multiple layers of convolution and learn effective latent representations that integrate information across the graph that represent the three dimensional structure of a protein of interest. An architecture that combines the learned features across pairs of proteins is then used to classify pairs of amino acid residues as part of an interface or not. In our experiments; several graph convolution operators yielded accuracy that is better than the state-of-the-art SVM method in this task.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7231-protein-interface-prediction-using-graph-convolutional-networks/bibtex,Alex Fout; Jonathon Byrd; Basir Shariat; Asa Ben-Hur

In contrast to other parallelisation techniques; it can be applied to a broad class of learning algorithms without further mathematical derivations and without writing dedicated code; while at the same time maintaining theoretical performance guarantees. Moreover; our parallelisation scheme is able to reduce the runtime of many learning algorithms to polylogarithmic time on quasi-polynomially many processing units. This is a significant step towards a general answer to an open question on efficient parallelisation of machine learning algorithms in the sense of Nick's Class (NC). The cost of this parallelisation is in the form of a larger sample complexity. Our empirical study confirms the potential of our parallelisation scheme with fixed numbers of processors and instances in realistic application scenarios.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7226-effective-parallelisation-for-machine-learning/bibtex,Michael Kamp; Mario Boley; Olana Missura; Thomas G?rtner

Theoretically we show that given the discriminator objective; good semi-supervised learning indeed requires a bad generator; and propose the definition of a preferred generator. Empirically; we derive a novel formulation based on our analysis that substantially improves over feature matching GANs; obtaining state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7229-good-semi-supervised-learning-that-requires-a-bad-gan/bibtex,Zihang Dai; Zhilin Yang; Fan Yang; William W.

2017,Semisupervised Clustering; AND-Queries and Locally Encodable Source Coding,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7227-semisupervised-clustering-and-queries-and-locally-encodable-source-coding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7227-semisupervised-clustering-and-queries-and-locally-encodable-source-coding,Source coding is the canonical problem of data compression in information theory. In a  locally encodable source coding; each compressed bit depends on only few bits of the input. In this paper; we show that a recently popular model of semisupervised clustering is equivalent to locally encodable source coding. In this model; the task is to perform multiclass labeling of unlabeled elements. At the beginning; we can ask in parallel a set of simple queries to an oracle who provides (possibly erroneous) binary answers  to the queries. The queries cannot involve more than two (or a fixed constant number $\Delta$ of) elements. Now the labeling of all the elements (or clustering) must be performed based on the (noisy) query answers. The goal is to recover all the correct labelings while minimizing the number of such queries. The equivalence to locally encodable source codes leads us to find  lower bounds on the number of queries required in variety of scenarios. We are also able to show fundamental limitations of pairwise `same cluster' queries - and propose pairwise AND queries; that provably performs better in many situations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7227-semisupervised-clustering-and-queries-and-locally-encodable-source-coding/bibtex,Arya Mazumdar; Soumyabrata Pal

To better understand this issue; we study the problem of continual learning; where the model observes; once and one by one; examples concerning a sequence of tasks. First; we propose a set of metrics to evaluate models learning over a continuum of data. These metrics characterize models not only by their test accuracy; but also in terms of their ability to transfer knowledge across tasks. Second; we propose a model for continual learning; called Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) that alleviates forgetting; while allowing beneficial transfer of knowledge to previous tasks. Our experiments on variants of the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate the strong performance of GEM when compared to the state-of-the-art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7225-gradient-episodic-memory-for-continual-learning/bibtex,David Lopez-Paz; Marc'Aurelio Ranzato

In this paper we propose a provably polynomial-time algorithm for learning sparse Gaussian Bayesian networks with equal noise variance --- a class of Bayesian networks for which the DAG structure can be uniquely identified from observational data --- under high-dimensional settings. We show that $O(k^4 \log p)$ number of samples suffices for our method to recover the true DAG structure with high probability; where $p$ is the number of variables and $k$ is the maximum Markov blanket size. We obtain our theoretical guarantees under a condition called \emph{restricted strong adjacency faithfulness} (RSAF); which is strictly weaker than strong faithfulness --- a condition that other methods based on conditional independence testing need for their success. The sample complexity of our method matches the information-theoretic limits in terms of the dependence on $p$. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7224-learning-identifiable-gaussian-bayesian-networks-in-polynomial-time-and-sample-complexity/bibtex,Asish Ghoshal; Jean Honorio

However; existing linear techniques for neural decoding may not fully reveal or exploit the fidelity of  the neural signal. Here we develop a new approximate Bayesian method for decoding natural images from the spiking activity of  populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We sidestep known computational challenges with Bayesian inference by exploiting artificial neural networks developed for computer vision; enabling fast nonlinear decoding that incorporates natural scene statistics implicitly.  We use a decoder architecture that first linearly reconstructs an image from RGC spikes; then applies a convolutional autoencoder to enhance the image. The resulting decoder; trained on natural images and simulated neural responses; significantly outperforms linear decoding; as well as simple point-wise nonlinear decoding. These results provide a tool for the assessment and optimization of retinal prosthesis technologies; and reveal that the retina may provide a more accurate representation of the visual scene than previously appreciated.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7222-neural-networks-for-efficient-bayesian-decoding-of-natural-images-from-retinal-neurons/bibtex,Nikhil Parthasarathy; Eleanor Batty; William Falcon; Thomas Rutten; Mohit Rajpal; E.J.

However; in many practical applications such as collaborative filtering and network analysis;  we only get a partial observation. Under such scenarios; we consider the fundamental problem of recovering various spectral properties of the underlying matrix from a sampling of its entries. We propose a framework of first estimating the Schatten $k$-norms of a matrix for several values of $k$; and using these as surrogates for estimating spectral properties of interest; such as   the spectrum itself or the rank.  This paper focuses on the technical challenges in accurately estimating the Schatten norms from a sampling of a matrix. We introduce  a novel unbiased estimator based on counting small structures in a graph and provide  guarantees that match its empirical performances.  Our theoretical analysis shows that Schatten norms can be recovered accurately from strictly smaller number of samples compared to what is needed to recover the underlying low-rank matrix. Numerical experiments suggest that we significantly improve upon a competing approach of using matrix completion methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7221-matrix-norm-estimation-from-a-few-entries/bibtex,Ashish Khetan; Sewoong Oh

The most important aspect of inferring causal effects from observational data is the handling of confounders; factors that affect both an intervention and its outcome. A carefully designed observational study attempts to measure all important confounders. However; even if one does not have direct access to all confounders; there may exist noisy and uncertain measurement of proxies for confounders. We build on recent advances in latent variable modeling to simultaneously estimate the unknown latent space summarizing the confounders and the causal effect. Our method is based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) which follow the causal structure of inference with proxies. We show our method is significantly more robust than existing methods; and matches the state-of-the-art on previous benchmarks focused on individual treatment effects.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7223-causal-effect-inference-with-deep-latent-variable-models/bibtex,Christos Louizos; Uri Shalit; Joris M.

For nearly all of these decisions there is a risk that individuals of a certain race; gender; sexual orientation; or any other subpopulation are unfairly discriminated against. Our recent method has demonstrated how to use techniques from counterfactual inference to make predictions fair across different subpopulations. This method requires that one provides the causal model that generated the data at hand. In general; validating all causal implications of the model is not possible without further assumptions. Hence; it is desirable to integrate competing causal models to provide counterfactually fair decisions; regardless of which causal "world" is the correct one. In this paper; we show how it is possible to make predictions that are approximately fair with respect to multiple possible causal models at once; thus mitigating the problem of exact causal specification. We frame the goal of learning a fair classifier as an optimization problem with fairness constraints entailed by competing causal explanations. We show how this optimization problem can be efficiently solved using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the flexibility of our model on two real-world fair classification problems. We show that our model can seamlessly balance fairness in multiple worlds with prediction accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7220-when-worlds-collide-integrating-different-counterfactual-assumptions-in-fairness/bibtex,Chris Russell; Matt J.

Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem.  Bayesian NNs; which learn a distribution over weights; are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian)  NNs.  We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement; readily parallelizable; requires very little hyperparameter tuning; and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks; we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift; we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions; and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7219-simple-and-scalable-predictive-uncertainty-estimation-using-deep-ensembles/bibtex,Balaji Lakshminarayanan; Alexander Pritzel; Charles Blundell

The servers must communicate with a referee and the goal is to estimate the underlying distribution with as few bits of communication as possible. We focus on non-parametric density estimation of discrete distributions with respect to the l1 and l2 norms. We provide the first non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the communication complexity of this basic estimation task in various settings of interest. Specifically; our results include the following:   1. When the unknown discrete distribution is unstructured and each server has only one sample; we show that any blackboard protocol (i.e.; any protocol in which servers interact arbitrarily using public messages) that learns the distribution must essentially communicate the entire sample.  2. For the case of structured distributions; such as k-histograms and monotone distributions; we design distributed learning algorithms that achieve significantly better communication guarantees than the naive ones; and obtain tight upper and lower bounds in several regimes. Our distributed learning algorithms run in near-linear time and are robust to model misspecification.  Our results provide insights on the interplay between structure and communication efficiency for a range of fundamental distribution estimation tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7218-communication-efficient-distributed-learning-of-discrete-distributions/bibtex,Ilias Diakonikolas; Elena Grigorescu; Jerry Li; Abhiram Natarajan; Krzysztof Onak; Ludwig Schmidt

We begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case: Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment; while policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows. We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multi-agent coordination. Additionally; we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies. We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios; where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7217-multi-agent-actor-critic-for-mixed-cooperative-competitive-environments/bibtex,Ryan Lowe; YI WU; Aviv Tamar; Jean Harb; OpenAI Pieter Abbeel; Igor Mordatch

To establish convergence with minimal information requirements on the players' side; we focus on two frameworks: the semi-bandit case (where players have access to a noisy estimate of their payoff vectors; including strategies they did not play); and the bandit case (where players are only able to observe their in-game; realized payoffs). In the semi-bandit case; we show that the induced sequence of play converges almost surely to a Nash equilibrium at a quasi-exponential rate. In the bandit case; the same result holds for approximate Nash equilibria if we introduce a constant exploration factor that guarantees that action choice probabilities never become arbitrarily small. In particular; if the algorithm is run with a suitably decreasing exploration factor; the sequence of play converges to a bona fide Nash equilibrium with probability 1.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7216-learning-with-bandit-feedback-in-potential-games/bibtex,Am?lie Heliou; Johanne Cohen; Panayotis Mertikopoulos
2017,Robust Conditional Probabilities,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7215-robust-conditional-probabilities.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7215-robust-conditional-probabilities,Conditional probabilities are a core concept in machine learning. For example; optimal prediction of a label $Y$ given an input $X$ corresponds to maximizing the conditional probability of $Y$ given $X$. A common approach to inference tasks is learning a model of conditional probabilities. However; these models are often based on strong assumptions (e.g.; log-linear models); and hence their estimate of conditional probabilities is not robust and is highly dependent on the validity of their assumptions.  Here we propose a framework for reasoning about conditional probabilities without assuming anything about the underlying distributions; except knowledge of their second order marginals; which can be estimated from data. We show how this setting leads to guaranteed bounds on conditional probabilities; which can be calculated efficiently in a variety of settings; including structured-prediction. Finally; we apply them to semi-supervised deep learning; obtaining results competitive with variational autoencoders.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7215-robust-conditional-probabilities/bibtex,Yoav Wald; Amir Globerson
2017,Generalizing GANs: A Turing Perspective,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7211-generalizing-gans-a-turing-perspective.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7211-generalizing-gans-a-turing-perspective,Recently; a new class of machine learning algorithms has emerged; where models and discriminators are generated in a competitive setting. The most prominent example is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this paper we examine how these algorithms relate to the Turing test; and derive what - from a Turing perspective - can be considered their defining features. Based on these features; we outline directions for generalizing GANs - resulting in the family of algorithms referred to as Turing Learning. One such direction is to allow the discriminators to interact with the processes from which the data samples are obtained; making them "interrogators"; as in the Turing test. We validate this idea using two case studies. In the first case study; a computer infers the behavior of an agent while controlling its environment. In the second case study; a robot infers its own sensor configuration while controlling its movements. The results confirm that by allowing discriminators to interrogate; the accuracy of models is improved.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7211-generalizing-gans-a-turing-perspective/bibtex,Roderich Gross; Yue Gu; Wei Li; Melvin Gauci
2017,Learning Combinatorial Optimization Algorithms over Graphs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7214-learning-combinatorial-optimization-algorithms-over-graphs.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7214-learning-combinatorial-optimization-algorithms-over-graphs,The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging; tedious process; and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications; it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis; maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems.  In this paper; we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution; and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs; and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover; Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7214-learning-combinatorial-optimization-algorithms-over-graphs/bibtex,Elias Khalil; Hanjun Dai; Yuyu Zhang; Bistra Dilkina; Le Song

Natural language processing (NLP) typically sees initialization of only the lowest layer of deep models with pretrained word vectors. In this paper; we use a deep LSTM encoder from an attentional sequence-to-sequence model trained for machine translation (MT) to contextualize word vectors. We show that adding these context vectors (CoVe) improves performance over using only unsupervised word and character vectors on a wide variety of common NLP tasks: sentiment analysis (SST; IMDb); question classification (TREC); entailment (SNLI); and question answering (SQuAD). For fine-grained sentiment analysis and entailment; CoVe improves performance of our baseline models to the state of the art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7209-learned-in-translation-contextualized-word-vectors/bibtex,Bryan McCann; James Bradbury; Caiming Xiong; Richard Socher

We propose novel O(n) approaches to estimating these quantities from only fast matrix vector multiplications (MVMs). These stochastic approximations are based on Chebyshev; Lanczos; and surrogate models; and converge quickly even for kernel matrices that have challenging spectra.  We leverage these approximations to develop a scalable Gaussian process approach to kernel learning. We find that Lanczos is generally superior to Chebyshev for kernel learning; and that a surrogate approach can be highly efficient and accurate with popular kernels.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7212-scalable-log-determinants-for-gaussian-process-kernel-learning/bibtex,Kun Dong; David Eriksson; Hannes Nickisch; David Bindel; Andrew G.

Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7213-poincare-embeddings-for-learning-hierarchical-representations.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7213-poincare-embeddings-for-learning-hierarchical-representations,Representation learning has become an invaluable approach for learning from symbolic data such as text and graphs. However; state-of-the-art embedding methods typically do not account for latent hierarchical structures which are characteristic for many complex symbolic datasets. In this work; we introduce a new approach for learning hierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic space -- or more precisely into an n-dimensional Poincar? ball. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry; this allows us to learn parsimonious representations of symbolic data by simultaneously capturing hierarchy and similarity. We present an efficient algorithm to learn the embeddings based on Riemannian optimization and show experimentally that Poincar? embeddings can outperform Euclidean embeddings significantly on data with latent hierarchies; both in terms of representation capacity and in terms of generalization ability.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7213-poincare-embeddings-for-learning-hierarchical-representations/bibtex,Maximillian Nickel; Douwe Kiela
2017,Population Matching Discrepancy and Applications in Deep Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7206-population-matching-discrepancy-and-applications-in-deep-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7206-population-matching-discrepancy-and-applications-in-deep-learning,A differentiable estimation of the distance between two distributions based on samples is important for many deep learning tasks. One such estimation  is maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). However; MMD suffers from its sensitive kernel bandwidth hyper-parameter; weak gradients; and large mini-batch size when used as a training objective. In this paper; we propose population matching discrepancy (PMD) for estimating the distribution distance based on samples; as well as an algorithm to learn the parameters of the distributions using PMD as an objective. PMD is defined as the minimum weight matching of sample populations from each distribution; and we prove that PMD is a strongly consistent estimator of the first Wasserstein metric. We apply PMD to two deep learning tasks; domain adaptation and generative modeling. Empirical results demonstrate that PMD overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks of MMD; and outperforms MMD on both tasks in terms of the performance as well as the convergence speed.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7206-population-matching-discrepancy-and-applications-in-deep-learning/bibtex,Jianfei Chen; Chongxuan LI; Yizhong Ru; Jun Zhu

In this paper; we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model; the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE); differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete; rather than continuous; codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation; we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of ``posterior collapse'' -? where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -? typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior; the model can generate high quality images; videos; and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes; providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7210-neural-discrete-representation-learning/bibtex,Aaron van den Oord; Oriol Vinyals; koray kavukcuoglu

To this end; we demonstrate that hybrid planning with Tensorflow and RMSProp gradient descent is competitive with mixed integer linear program (MILP) based optimization on piecewise linear planning domains (where we can compute optimal solutions) and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art interior point methods for nonlinear planning domains.  Furthermore; we remark that Tensorflow is highly scalable; converging to a strong plan on a large-scale concurrent domain with a total of 576;000 continuous action parameters distributed over a horizon of 96 time steps and 100 parallel instances in only 4 minutes.  We provide a number of insights that clarify such strong performance including observations that despite long horizons; RMSProp avoids both the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. Together these results suggest a new frontier for highly scalable planning in nonlinear hybrid domains by leveraging GPUs and the power of recent advances in gradient descent with highly optimized toolkits like Tensorflow.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7207-scalable-planning-with-tensorflow-for-hybrid-nonlinear-domains/bibtex,Ga Wu; Buser Say; Scott Sanner

This bound is empirically investigated for a standard AlexNet network trained with SGD on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets; with both original and random labels;  the bound; the Lipschitz constants; and the excess risks are all in direct correlation; suggesting both that SGD selects predictors whose complexity scales with the difficulty of the learning task; and secondly that the presented bound is sensitive to this complexity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7204-spectrally-normalized-margin-bounds-for-neural-networks/bibtex,Peter L.

2017,Boltzmann Exploration Done Right,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7208-boltzmann-exploration-done-right.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7208-boltzmann-exploration-done-right,Boltzmann exploration is a classic strategy for sequential decision-making under uncertainty; and is one of the most standard tools in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Despite its widespread use; there is virtually no theoretical understanding about the limitations or the actual benefits of this exploration scheme. Does it drive exploration in a meaningful way? Is it prone to misidentifying the optimal actions or spending too much time exploring the suboptimal ones? What is the right tuning for the learning rate? In this paper; we address several of these questions for the classic setup of stochastic multi-armed bandits. One of our main results is showing that the Boltzmann exploration strategy with any monotone learning-rate sequence will induce suboptimal behavior. As a remedy; we offer a simple non-monotone schedule that guarantees near-optimal performance; albeit only when given prior access to key problem parameters that are typically not available in practical situations (like the time horizon $T$ and the suboptimality gap $\Delta$). More importantly; we propose a novel variant that uses different learning rates for different arms; and achieves a distribution-dependent regret bound of order $\frac{K\log^2 T}{\Delta}$ and a distribution-independent bound of order $\sqrt{KT}\log K$ without requiring such prior knowledge. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique; we also propose a variant that guarantees the same performance bounds even if the rewards are heavy-tailed.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7208-boltzmann-exploration-done-right/bibtex,Nicol?

2017,Hierarchical Clustering Beyond the Worst-Case,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7200-hierarchical-clustering-beyond-the-worst-case.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7200-hierarchical-clustering-beyond-the-worst-case,Hiererachical clustering; that is computing a recursive partitioning of a dataset to obtain clusters at increasingly finer granularity is a fundamental problem in data analysis. Although hierarchical clustering has mostly been studied through procedures such as linkage algorithms; or top-down heuristics; rather than as optimization problems; recently Dasgupta [1] proposed an objective function for hierarchical clustering and initiated a line of work developing algorithms that explicitly optimize an objective (see also [2; 3; 4]). In this paper; we consider a fairly general random graph model for hierarchical clustering; called the hierarchical stochastic blockmodel (HSBM); and show that in certain regimes the SVD approach of McSherry [5] combined with specific linkage methods results in a clustering that give an O(1)-approximation to Dasgupta?s cost function. We also show that an approach based on SDP relaxations for balanced cuts based on the work of Makarychev et al. [6]; combined with the recursive sparsest cut algorithm of Dasgupta; yields an O(1) approximation in slightly larger regimes and also in the semi-random setting; where an adversary may remove edges from the random graph generated according to an HSBM. Finally; we report empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world  data showing that our proposed SVD-based method does indeed achieve a better cost than other widely-used heurstics and also results in a better classification accuracy when the underlying problem was that of multi-class classification.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7200-hierarchical-clustering-beyond-the-worst-case/bibtex,Vincent Cohen-Addad; Varun Kanade; Frederik Mallmann-Trenn
2017,Asynchronous Coordinate Descent under More Realistic Assumptions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7198-asynchronous-coordinate-descent-under-more-realistic-assumptions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7198-asynchronous-coordinate-descent-under-more-realistic-assumptions,Asynchronous-parallel algorithms have the potential to vastly speed up algorithms by eliminating costly synchronization. However; our understanding of these algorithms is limited because the current convergence theory of asynchronous block coordinate descent algorithms is based on somewhat unrealistic assumptions. In particular; the age of the shared optimization variables being used to update blocks is assumed to be independent of the block being updated. Additionally; it is assumed that the updates are applied to randomly chosen blocks.  In this paper; we argue that these assumptions either fail to hold or will imply less efficient implementations. We then prove the convergence of asynchronous-parallel block coordinate descent under more realistic assumptions; in particular; always without the independence assumption. The analysis permits both the deterministic (essentially) cyclic and random rules for block choices. Because a bound on the asynchronous delays may or may not be available; we establish convergence for both bounded delays and unbounded delays. The analysis also covers nonconvex; weakly convex; and strongly convex functions. The convergence theory involves a Lyapunov function that directly incorporates both objective progress and delays. A continuous-time ODE is provided to motivate the construction at a high level.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7198-asynchronous-coordinate-descent-under-more-realistic-assumptions/bibtex,Tao Sun; Robert Hannah; Wotao Yin

Our new framework correctly models the joint uncertainty in the latent parameters and the state space.  We also replace the original Gaussian Process-based model with a Bayesian Neural Network; enabling more scalable inference.  Thus; we expand the scope of the HiP-MDP to applications with higher dimensions and more complex dynamics.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7205-robust-and-efficient-transfer-learning-with-hidden-parameter-markov-decision-processes/bibtex,Taylor W.

2017,Statistical Cost Sharing,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7202-statistical-cost-sharing.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7202-statistical-cost-sharing,We study the cost sharing problem for cooperative games in situations where the cost function C is not available via oracle queries; but must instead be learned from samples drawn from a distribution; represented as tuples (S; C(S)); for different subsets S of players. We formalize this approach; which we call statistical cost sharing; and consider the computation of the core and the Shapley value.  Expanding on the work by Balcan et al; we give precise sample complexity bounds for computing cost shares that satisfy the core property with high probability for any function with a non-empty core. For the Shapley value; which has never been studied in this setting; we show that for submodular cost functions with curvature bounded curvature kappa it can be approximated from samples from the uniform distribution to a sqrt{1 - kappa} factor; and that the bound is tight. We then define statistical analogues of the Shapley axioms; and derive a notion of statistical Shapley value and that these can  be approximated arbitrarily well from samples from any distribution and for any function.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7202-statistical-cost-sharing/bibtex,Eric Balkanski; Umar Syed; Sergei Vassilvitskii
2017,The Expressive Power of Neural Networks: A View from the Width,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7203-the-expressive-power-of-neural-networks-a-view-from-the-width.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7203-the-expressive-power-of-neural-networks-a-view-from-the-width,The expressive power of neural networks is important for understanding deep learning. Most existing works consider this problem from the view of the depth of a network. In this paper; we study how width affects the expressiveness of neural networks. Classical results state that depth-bounded (e.g. depth-2) networks with suitable activation functions are universal approximators. We show a universal approximation theorem for width-bounded ReLU networks: width-(n + 4) ReLU networks; where n is the input dimension; are universal approximators. Moreover; except for a measure zero set; all functions cannot be approximated by width-n ReLU networks; which exhibits a phase transition. Several recent works demonstrate the benefits of depth by proving the depth-efficiency of neural networks. That is; there are classes of deep networks which cannot be realized by any shallow network whose size is no more than an exponential bound. Here we pose the dual question on the width-efficiency of ReLU networks: Are there wide networks that cannot be realized by narrow networks whose size is not substantially larger? We show that there exist classes of wide networks which cannot be realized by any narrow network whose depth is no more than a polynomial bound. On the other hand; we demonstrate by extensive experiments that narrow networks whose size exceed the polynomial bound by a constant factor can approximate wide and shallow network with high accuracy. Our results provide more comprehensive evidence that depth may be more effective than width for the expressiveness of ReLU networks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7203-the-expressive-power-of-neural-networks-a-view-from-the-width/bibtex,Zhou Lu; Hongming Pu; Feicheng Wang; Zhiqiang Hu; Liwei Wang

This is achieved by generalizing the multilayer kernel introduced in the context of convolutional kernel networks and by studying the geometry of the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that the signal representation is stable; and that models from this functional space; such as a large class of convolutional neural networks; may enjoy the same stability.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7201-invariance-and-stability-of-deep-convolutional-representations/bibtex,Alberto Bietti; Julien Mairal

Reconstruction of X from the singular values and singular vectors of the  contaminated matrix Y is a key problem in machine learning; computer vision and data science.  In this paper we show that common contamination models   (including arbitrary combinations of uniform noise; missing values; outliers and corrupt entries) can be described efficiently using a single framework. We develop an asymptotically optimal algorithm that estimates X by manipulation of the singular values of Y; which applies to any of the contamination models considered.  Finally; we find an explicit signal-to-noise cutoff; below which estimation of X from the singular value decomposition of Y must fail; in a well-defined sense.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7196-optimal-shrinkage-of-singular-values-under-random-data-contamination/bibtex,Danny Barash; Matan Gavish

Our algorithm replaces the top singular-vector computation (1-SVD) in Frank-Wolfe with a top-k singular-vector computation (k-SVD); which can be done by repeatedly applying 1-SVD k times. Alternatively; our algorithm can be viewed as a rank-k restricted version of projected gradient descent. We show that our algorithm has a linear convergence rate when the objective function is smooth and strongly convex; and the optimal solution has rank at most k. This improves the convergence rate and the total time complexity of the Frank-Wolfe method and its variants.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7199-linear-convergence-of-a-frank-wolfe-type-algorithm-over-trace-norm-balls/bibtex,Zeyuan Allen-Zhu; Elad Hazan; Wei Hu; Yuanzhi Li

Instead of focusing on specific games; we consider a broad class of continuous games defined by the general equilibrium stability notion; which we call ?-variational stability. Our first contribution is that; in this class of games; the actual sequence of play induced by OMD-based learning converges to Nash equilibria provided that the feedback delays faced by the players are synchronous and bounded. Subsequently; to tackle fully decentralized; asynchronous environments with (possibly) unbounded delays between actions and feedback; we propose a variant of OMD which we call delayed mirror descent (DMD); and which relies on the repeated leveraging of past information. With this modification; the algorithm converges to Nash equilibria with no feedback synchronicity assumptions and even when the delays grow superlinearly relative to the horizon of play.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7197-countering-feedback-delays-in-multi-agent-learning/bibtex,Zhengyuan Zhou; Panayotis Mertikopoulos; Nicholas Bambos; Peter W.

The result shows that; from the perspective of learning errors; performances of approximate inference could be as good as exact inference. The error analyses also suggest a new margin for existing learning algorithms.

This model is motivated by applications to channel estimation; optics; and underwater acoustic communication; where the signal of interest is acted on by a given channel/filter; and phase information is difficult or impossible to acquire. We show that when $\mathbf a$ is random and $m \geq \Omega(\frac{ \| \mathbf C_{\mathbf x}\|^2}{ \|\mathbf x\|^2 }  n \mathrm{poly} \log n)$; $\mathbf x$ can be efficiently recovered up to a global phase using a combination of spectral initialization and generalized gradient descent. The main challenge is coping with dependencies in the measurement operator; we overcome this challenge by using ideas from decoupling theory; suprema of chaos processes and the restricted isometry property of random circulant matrices; and recent analysis for alternating minimizing methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7189-convolutional-phase-retrieval/bibtex,Qing Qu; Yuqian Zhang; Yonina Eldar; John Wright

Although consistency results have been established in some settings; such estimators are less well-understood than their analogues based on penalized regularization.  In this paper; for a relatively broad   class of loss functions and boosting algorithms (including   $L^2$-boost; LogitBoost and AdaBoost; among others); we connect the performance of a stopped iterate to the localized  Rademacher/Gaussian complexity of the associated function class. This connection allows us to show that local fixed point analysis; now standard in the analysis of penalized estimators; can be used to derive optimal stopping rules.  We derive such stopping rules in detail for various kernel classes; and illustrate the correspondence of our theory with practice for Sobolev kernel classes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7187-early-stopping-for-kernel-boosting-algorithms-a-general-analysis-with-localized-complexities/bibtex,Yuting Wei; Fanny Yang; Martin J.

They are naturally in the form of saddle-point optimization; often with separable structure but sometimes also with unmanageably large dimension. In this work we show that adversarial prediction under multivariate losses can be solved much faster than they used to be. We first reduce the problem size exponentially by using appropriate sufficient statistics; and then we adapt the new stochastic variance-reduced algorithm of Balamurugan & Bach (2016) to allow any Bregman divergence. We prove that the same linear rate of convergence is retained and we show that for adversarial prediction using KL-divergence we can further achieve a speedup of #example times compared with the Euclidean alternative. We verify the theoretical findings through extensive experiments on two example applications: adversarial prediction and LPboosting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7184-bregman-divergence-for-stochastic-variance-reduction-saddle-point-and-adversarial-prediction/bibtex,Zhan Shi; Xinhua Zhang; Yaoliang Yu
2017,Efficient Second-Order Online Kernel Learning with Adaptive Embedding,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7194-efficient-second-order-online-kernel-learning-with-adaptive-embedding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7194-efficient-second-order-online-kernel-learning-with-adaptive-embedding,Online kernel learning (OKL) is a flexible framework to approach prediction problems; since the large approximation space provided by reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces can contain an accurate function for the problem. Nonetheless; optimizing over this space is computationally expensive. Not only first order methods accumulate $\O(\sqrt{T})$ more loss than the optimal function; but the curse of kernelization results in a $\O(t)$ per step complexity. Second-order methods get closer to the optimum much faster; suffering only $\O(\log(T))$ regret; but second-order updates are even more expensive; with a $\O(t^2)$ per-step cost. Existing approximate OKL methods try to reduce this complexity either by limiting the Support Vectors (SV) introduced in the predictor; or by avoiding the kernelization process altogether using embedding. Nonetheless; as long as the size of the approximation space or the number of SV does not grow over time; an adversary can always exploit the approximation process. In this paper; we propose PROS-N-KONS; a method that combines Nystrom sketching to project the input point in a small; accurate embedded space; and performs efficient second-order updates in this space. The embedded space is continuously updated to guarantee that the embedding remains accurate; and we show that the per-step cost only grows with the effective dimension of the problem and not with $T$. Moreover; the second-order updated allows us to achieve the logarithmic regret.

2017,Gaussian Quadrature for Kernel Features,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7191-gaussian-quadrature-for-kernel-features.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7191-gaussian-quadrature-for-kernel-features,Kernel methods have recently attracted resurgent interest; showing performance competitive with deep neural networks in tasks such as speech recognition. The random Fourier features map is a technique commonly used to scale up kernel machines; but employing the randomized feature map means that $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples are required to achieve an approximation error of at most $\epsilon$. We investigate some alternative schemes for constructing feature maps that are deterministic; rather than random; by approximating the kernel in the frequency domain using Gaussian quadrature. We show that deterministic feature maps can be constructed; for any $\gamma > 0$; to achieve error $\epsilon$ with $O(e^{e^\gamma} + \epsilon^{-1/\gamma})$ samples as $\epsilon$ goes to 0. Our method works particularly well with sparse ANOVA kernels; which are inspired by the convolutional layer of CNNs. We validate our methods on datasets in different domains; such as MNIST and TIMIT; showing that deterministic features are faster to generate and achieve accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art kernel methods based on random Fourier features.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7191-gaussian-quadrature-for-kernel-features/bibtex,Tri Dao; Christopher M.

2017,Value Prediction Network,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7192-value-prediction-network.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7192-value-prediction-network,This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (RL) architecture; called Value Prediction Network (VPN); which integrates model-free and model-based RL methods into a single neural network. In contrast to typical model-based RL methods; VPN learns a dynamics model whose abstract states are trained to make option-conditional predictions of future values (discounted sum of rewards) rather than of future observations. Our experimental results show that VPN has several advantages over both model-free and model-based baselines in a stochastic environment where careful planning is required but building an accurate observation-prediction model is difficult. Furthermore; VPN outperforms Deep Q-Network (DQN) on several Atari games even with short-lookahead planning; demonstrating its potential as a new way of learning a good state representation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7192-value-prediction-network/bibtex,Junhyuk Oh; Satinder Singh; Honglak Lee

We deploy this tool to measure the intrinsic dimensionality of layers; showing in some cases needless over-parameterization; to probe learning dynamics throughout training; finding that networks converge to final representations from the bottom up; to show where class-specific information in networks is formed; and to suggest new training regimes that simultaneously save computation and overfit less.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7188-svcca-singular-vector-canonical-correlation-analysis-for-deep-learning-dynamics-and-interpretability/bibtex,Maithra Raghu; Justin Gilmer; Jason Yosinski; Jascha Sohl-Dickstein

To bypass the requirements of Gaussianity or elliptical symmetry of covariates in existing methods; we propose to leverage a second-order Stein?s method with score function-based corrections. We prove that our estimator achieves a near-optimal statistical rate of convergence even when the score function or the response variable is heavy-tailed. To establish the key concentration results; we develop a data-driven truncation argument that may be of independent interest. We supplement our theoretical findings with simulations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7190-estimating-high-dimensional-non-gaussian-multiple-index-models-via-steins-lemma/bibtex,Zhuoran Yang; krishnakumar balasubramanian; Princeton Zhaoran Wang; Han Liu

Departing from previous work; which has focused on highly structured function classes such as nested balls in Hilbert space; we propose a generic meta-algorithm framework that achieves online model selection oracle inequalities under minimal structural assumptions. We give the first computationally efficient parameter-free algorithms that work in arbitrary Banach spaces under mild smoothness assumptions; previous results applied only to Hilbert spaces. We further derive new oracle inequalities for matrix classes; non-nested convex sets; and $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with generic regularizers. Finally; we generalize these results by providing oracle inequalities for arbitrary non-linear classes in the online supervised learning model.    These results are all derived through a unified meta-algorithm scheme using a novel "multi-scale" algorithm for prediction with expert advice based on random playout; which may be of independent interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7183-parameter-free-online-learning-via-model-selection/bibtex,Dylan J.

PSRNNs draw on insights from both Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Predictive State Representations (PSRs); and inherit advantages from both types of models. Like many successful RNN architectures; PSRNNs use (potentially deeply composed) bilinear transfer functions to combine information from multiple sources. We show that such bilinear functions arise naturally from state updates in Bayes filters like PSRs; in which observations can be viewed as gating belief states. We also show that PSRNNs can be learned effectively by combining Backpropogation Through Time (BPTT) with an initialization  derived from a statistically consistent learning algorithm for PSRs called two-stage regression (2SR). Finally; we show that PSRNNs can be  factorized using tensor decomposition; reducing model size and suggesting interesting connections to existing multiplicative architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs. We apply PSRNNs to 4 datasets; and show that we outperform several popular alternative approaches to modeling dynamical systems in all cases.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7186-predictive-state-recurrent-neural-networks/bibtex,Carlton Downey; Ahmed Hefny; Byron Boots; Geoffrey J.

These models only capture the local context; of up to a few thousands tokens. In this paper; we propose an extension of continuous cache models; which can scale to larger contexts. In particular; we use a large scale non-parametric memory component that stores all the hidden activations seen in the past. We leverage recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search and quantization algorithms to store millions of representations while searching them efficiently. We conduct extensive experiments showing that our approach significantly improves the perplexity of pre-trained language models on new distributions; and can scale efficiently to much larger contexts than previously proposed local cache models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7185-unbounded-cache-model-for-online-language-modeling-with-open-vocabulary/bibtex,Edouard Grave; Moustapha M.

We demonstrate that the recurrent Ladder is able to handle a wide variety of complex learning tasks that benefit from iterative inference and temporal modeling. The architecture shows close-to-optimal results on temporal modeling of video data; competitive results on music modeling; and improved perceptual grouping based on higher order abstractions; such as stochastic textures and motion cues. We present results for fully supervised; semi-supervised; and unsupervised tasks. The results suggest that the proposed architecture and principles are powerful tools for learning a hierarchy of abstractions; learning iterative inference and handling temporal information.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7182-recurrent-ladder-networks/bibtex,Isabeau Pr?mont-Schwarz; Alexander Ilin; Tele Hao; Antti Rasmus; Rinu Boney; Harri Valpola
2017,Estimating Mutual Information for Discrete-Continuous Mixtures,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7180-estimating-mutual-information-for-discrete-continuous-mixtures.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7180-estimating-mutual-information-for-discrete-continuous-mixtures,Estimation of mutual information from observed samples is a basic primitive in machine learning; useful in several learning tasks including correlation mining; information bottleneck; Chow-Liu tree; and conditional independence testing in (causal) graphical models. While mutual information is a quantity well-defined for general probability spaces; estimators have been developed only in the special case of discrete or continuous pairs of random variables. Most of these estimators operate using the 3H -principle; i.e.; by calculating the three (differential) entropies of X; Y and the pair (X;Y). However; in general mixture spaces; such individual entropies  are not well defined; even though mutual information is.  In this paper; we develop a novel estimator for estimating mutual information in discrete-continuous mixtures. We prove the consistency of this estimator theoretically as well as demonstrate its excellent empirical performance. This problem is relevant in a wide-array of applications; where some variables are discrete; some continuous; and others are a mixture between continuous and discrete components.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7180-estimating-mutual-information-for-discrete-continuous-mixtures/bibtex,Weihao Gao; Sreeram Kannan; Sewoong Oh; Pramod Viswanath
2017,Action Centered Contextual Bandits,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7179-action-centered-contextual-bandits.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7179-action-centered-contextual-bandits,Contextual bandits have become popular as they offer a middle ground between very simple approaches based on multi-armed bandits and very complex approaches using the full power of reinforcement learning. They have demonstrated success in web applications and have a rich body of associated theoretical guarantees. Linear models are well understood theoretically and preferred by practitioners because they are not only easily interpretable but also simple to implement and debug. Furthermore; if the linear model is true; we get very strong performance guarantees. Unfortunately; in emerging applications in mobile health; the time-invariant linear model assumption is untenable. We provide an extension of the linear model for contextual bandits that has two parts: baseline reward and treatment effect. We allow the former to be complex but keep the latter simple. We argue that this model is plausible for mobile health applications. At the same time; it leads to algorithms with strong performance guarantees as in the linear model setting; while still allowing for complex nonlinear baseline modeling. Our theory is supported by experiments on data gathered in a recently concluded mobile health study.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7179-action-centered-contextual-bandits/bibtex,Kristjan Greenewald; Ambuj Tewari; Susan Murphy; Predag Klasnja
2017,A framework for Multi-A(rmed)/B(andit) Testing with Online FDR Control,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7177-a-framework-for-multi-armedbandit-testing-with-online-fdr-control.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7177-a-framework-for-multi-armedbandit-testing-with-online-fdr-control,We propose an alternative framework to existing setups for controlling false alarms when multiple A/B tests are run over time. This setup arises in many practical applications; e.g. when pharmaceutical companies test new treatment options against control pills for different diseases; or when internet companies test their default webpages versus various alternatives over time. Our framework proposes to replace a sequence of A/B tests by a sequence of best-arm MAB instances; which can be continuously monitored by the data scientist. When interleaving the MAB tests with an online false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm; we can obtain the best of both worlds: low sample complexity and any time online FDR control. Our main contributions are: (i) to propose reasonable definitions of a null hypothesis for MAB instances; (ii) to demonstrate how one can derive an always-valid sequential p-value that allows continuous monitoring of each MAB test; and (iii) to show that using rejection thresholds of online-FDR algorithms as the confidence levels for the MAB algorithms results in both sample-optimality; high power and low FDR at any point in time. We run extensive simulations to verify our claims; and also report results on real data collected from the New Yorker Cartoon Caption contest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7177-a-framework-for-multi-armedbandit-testing-with-online-fdr-control/bibtex,Fanny Yang; Aaditya Ramdas; Kevin G.

As a result; after training; our model can generate different realistic versions of an input image by varying the attribute values. By using continuous attribute values; we can choose how much a specific attribute is perceivable in the generated image. This property could allow for applications where users can modify an image using sliding knobs; like faders on a mixing console; to change the facial expression of a portrait; or to update the color of some objects. Compared to the state-of-the-art which mostly relies on training adversarial networks in pixel space by altering attribute values at train time; our approach results in much simpler training schemes and nicely scales to multiple attributes. We present evidence that our model can significantly change the perceived value of the attributes while preserving the naturalness of images.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7178-fader-networksmanipulating-images-by-sliding-attributes/bibtex,Guillaume Lample; Neil Zeghidour; Nicolas Usunier; Antoine Bordes; Ludovic DENOYER; Marc'Aurelio Ranzato

In contrast to traditional fully supervised learning approaches; in this paper we propose learning intrinsic image decomposition by explaining the input image. Our model; the Rendered Intrinsics Network (RIN); joins together an image decomposition pipeline; which predicts reflectance; shape; and lighting conditions given a single image; with a recombination function; a learned shading model used to recompose the original input based off of intrinsic image predictions. Our network can then use unsupervised reconstruction error as an additional signal to improve its intermediate representations. This allows large-scale unlabeled data to be useful during training; and also enables transferring learned knowledge to images of unseen object categories; lighting conditions; and shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs well on both intrinsic image decomposition and knowledge transfer.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7175-self-supervised-intrinsic-image-decomposition/bibtex,Michael Janner; Jiajun Wu; Tejas D.

Typically these models encode all features of the data into a single variable. Here we are interested in learning disentangled representations that encode distinct aspects of the data into separate variables. We propose to learn such representations using model architectures that generalise from standard VAEs; employing a general graphical model structure in the encoder and decoder. This allows us to train partially-specified models that make relatively strong assumptions about a subset of interpretable variables and rely on the flexibility of neural networks to learn representations for the remaining variables. We further define a general objective for semi-supervised learning in this model class; which can be approximated using an importance sampling procedure. We evaluate our framework's ability to learn disentangled representations; both by qualitative exploration of its generative capacity; and quantitative evaluation of its discriminative ability on a variety of models and datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7174-learning-disentangled-representations-with-semi-supervised-deep-generative-models/bibtex,Siddharth Narayanaswamy; T.

While most advances focus on model parallelization and engaging multiple computing agents via using a central parameter server; aspect of data parallelization along with decentralized computation has not been explored sufficiently. In this context; this paper presents a new consensus-based distributed SGD (CDSGD) (and its momentum variant; CDMSGD) algorithm for collaborative deep learning over fixed topology networks that enables data parallelization as well as decentralized computation. Such a framework can be extremely useful for learning agents with access to only local/private data in a communication constrained environment. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm with strongly convex and nonconvex objective functions with fixed and diminishing step sizes using concepts of Lyapunov function construction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in comparison with the baseline centralized SGD and the recently proposed federated averaging algorithm (that also enables data parallelism) based on benchmark datasets such as MNIST; CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7172-collaborative-deep-learning-in-fixed-topology-networks/bibtex,Zhanhong Jiang; Aditya Balu; Chinmay Hegde; Soumik Sarkar

Here; we address this challenge by proposing a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture; the Fast-Slow RNN (FS-RNN). The FS-RNN incorporates the strengths of both  multiscale RNNs and deep transition RNNs as it processes sequential data on different timescales  and learns complex transition functions from one time step to the next. We evaluate the FS-RNN on two character based language modeling data sets; Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia; where  we improve state of the art results to  1.19 and 1.25 bits-per-character (BPC); respectively. In addition; an ensemble of two FS-RNNs achieves 1.20 BPC on  Hutter Prize Wikipedia outperforming  the best known compression algorithm with respect to the BPC measure. We also present an empirical investigation of the learning and network dynamics of the FS-RNN; which explains the improved performance compared to other RNN architectures. Our approach is general as any kind of RNN cell is a possible building block for the FS-RNN architecture;  and thus can be flexibly applied to different tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7173-fast-slow-recurrent-neural-networks/bibtex,Asier Mujika; Florian Meier; Angelika Steger

2017,The Importance of Communities for Learning to Influence,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7168-the-importance-of-communities-for-learning-to-influence.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7168-the-importance-of-communities-for-learning-to-influence,We consider the canonical problem of influence maximization in social networks. Since the seminal work of Kempe; Kleinberg; and Tardos there have been two; largely disjoint efforts on this problem. The first studies the problem associated with learning the generative model that produces cascades; and the second focuses on the algorithmic challenge of identifying a set of influencers; assuming the generative model is known. Recent results on learning and optimization imply that in general; if the generative model is not known but rather learned from training data; no algorithm for influence maximization can yield a constant factor approximation guarantee using polynomially-many samples; drawn from any distribution.  In this paper we describe a simple algorithm for maximizing influence from training data. The main idea behind the algorithm is to leverage the strong community structure of social networks and identify a set of individuals who are influentials but whose communities have little overlap. Although in general; the approximation guarantee of such an algorithm is unbounded; we show that this algorithm performs well experimentally. To analyze its performance; we prove this algorithm obtains a constant factor approximation guarantee on graphs generated through the stochastic block model; traditionally used to model networks with community structure.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7168-the-importance-of-communities-for-learning-to-influence/bibtex,Eric Balkanski; Nicole Immorlica; Yaron Singer

We analyze MWU in congestion games where agents use \textit{arbitrary admissible constants} as learning rates $\epsilon$ and prove convergence to \textit{exact Nash equilibria}. Interestingly; this convergence result does not carry over to the nearly homologous MWU variant where at each step the probability assigned to action $\gamma$ is multiplied by $(1 -\epsilon)^{C(\gamma)}$ even for the simplest case of two-agent; two-strategy load balancing games; where such dynamics can provably lead to limit cycles or even chaotic behavior.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7169-multiplicative-weights-update-with-constant-step-size-in-congestion-games-convergence-limit-cycles-and-chaos/bibtex,Gerasimos Palaiopanos; Ioannis Panageas; Georgios Piliouras

It opens the door to large-scale statistical models. Finding a unified perspective for all available data calls for scalable and automated solutions to an old challenge: how to aggregate heterogeneous information on brain function into a universal cognitive system that relates mental operations/cognitive processes/psychological tasks to brain networks? We cast this challenge in a machine-learning approach to predict conditions from statistical brain maps across different studies. For this; we leverage multi-task learning and multi-scale dimension reduction to learn low-dimensional representations of brain images that carry cognitive information and can be robustly associated with psychological stimuli. Our multi-dataset classification model achieves the best prediction performance on several large reference datasets; compared to models without cognitive-aware low-dimension representations; it brings a substantial performance boost to the analysis of small datasets; and can be introspected to identify universal template cognitive concepts.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7170-learning-neural-representations-of-human-cognition-across-many-fmri-studies/bibtex,Arthur Mensch; Julien Mairal; Danilo Bzdok; Bertrand Thirion; Gael Varoquaux

Despite the apparent lack of convexity in such functions; we prove that stochastic projected gradient methods can provide strong approximation guarantees for maximizing continuous submodular functions with convex constraints. More specifically; we prove that for monotone continuous DR-submodular functions; all fixed points of projected gradient ascent provide a factor $1/2$ approximation to the global maxima. We also study stochastic gradient methods and show that after $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations these methods reach solutions which achieve in expectation objective values exceeding $(\frac{\text{OPT}}{2}-\epsilon)$. An immediate application of our results is to maximize submodular functions that are defined stochastically; i.e. the submodular function is defined as an expectation over a family of submodular functions with an unknown distribution. We will show how stochastic gradient methods are naturally well-suited for this setting; leading to a factor $1/2$ approximation when the function is monotone. In particular; it allows us to approximately maximize discrete; monotone submodular optimization problems via projected gradient ascent on a continuous relaxation; directly connecting the discrete and continuous domains. Finally; experiments on real data demonstrate that our projected gradient methods consistently achieve the best utility compared to other continuous baselines while remaining competitive in terms of computational effort.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7166-gradient-methods-for-submodular-maximization/bibtex,Hamed Hassani; Mahdi Soltanolkotabi; Amin Karbasi

We model the spatially correlated portion using a time-varying Gaussian graphical model. Under assumptions on the smoothness of changes in covariance matrices;  we derive strong single sample convergence results; confirming our ability to estimate meaningful graphical structures as they evolve over time. We apply our methodology to the discovery of time-varying spatial structures in human brain fMRI signals.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7165-time-dependent-spatially-varying-graphical-models-with-application-to-brain-fmri-data-analysis/bibtex,Kristjan Greenewald; Seyoung Park; Shuheng Zhou; Alexander Giessing
2017,Permutation-based Causal Inference Algorithms with Interventions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7164-permutation-based-causal-inference-algorithms-with-interventions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7164-permutation-based-causal-inference-algorithms-with-interventions,Learning directed acyclic graphs using both observational and interventional data is now a fundamentally important problem due to recent technological developments in genomics that generate such single-cell gene expression data at a very large scale. In order to utilize this data for learning gene regulatory networks; efficient and reliable causal inference algorithms are needed that can make use of both observational and interventional data. In this paper; we present two algorithms of this type and prove that both are consistent under the faithfulness assumption. These algorithms are interventional adaptations of the Greedy SP algorithm and are the first algorithms using both observational and interventional data with consistency guarantees. Moreover; these algorithms have the advantage that they are nonparametric; which makes them useful also for analyzing non-Gaussian data. In this paper; we present these two algorithms and their consistency guarantees; and we analyze their performance on simulated data; protein signaling data; and single-cell gene expression data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7164-permutation-based-causal-inference-algorithms-with-interventions/bibtex,Yuhao Wang; Liam Solus; Karren Yang; Caroline Uhler
2017,Training Quantized Nets: A Deeper Understanding,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7163-training-quantized-nets-a-deeper-understanding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7163-training-quantized-nets-a-deeper-understanding,Currently; deep neural networks are deployed on low-power portable devices by first training a full-precision model using powerful hardware; and then deriving a corresponding low-precision model for efficient inference on such systems. However; training models directly with coarsely quantized weights is a key step towards learning on embedded platforms that have limited computing resources; memory capacity; and power consumption.  Numerous recent publications have studied methods for training quantized networks; but these studies have mostly been empirical. In this work; we investigate training methods for quantized neural networks from a theoretical viewpoint.  We first explore accuracy guarantees for training methods under convexity assumptions.  We then look at the behavior of these algorithms for non-convex problems; and show that training algorithms that exploit high-precision representations have an important greedy search phase that purely quantized training methods lack; which explains the difficulty of training using low-precision arithmetic.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7163-training-quantized-nets-a-deeper-understanding/bibtex,Hao Li; Soham De; Zheng Xu; Christoph Studer; Hanan Samet; Tom Goldstein
2017,Higher-Order Total Variation Classes on Grids: Minimax Theory and Trend Filtering Methods,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7162-higher-order-total-variation-classes-on-grids-minimax-theory-and-trend-filtering-methods.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7162-higher-order-total-variation-classes-on-grids-minimax-theory-and-trend-filtering-methods,We consider the problem of estimating the values of a function over $n$ nodes of a $d$-dimensional grid graph (having equal side lengths $n^{1/d}$) from noisy observations. The function is assumed to be smooth; but is allowed to exhibit different amounts of smoothness at different regions in the grid. Such heterogeneity eludes classical measures of smoothness from nonparametric statistics; such as Holder smoothness. Meanwhile; total variation (TV) smoothness classes allow for heterogeneity; but are restrictive in another sense: only constant functions count as perfectly smooth (achieve zero TV). To move past this; we define two new higher-order TV classes; based on two ways of compiling the discrete derivatives of a parameter across the nodes. We relate these two new classes to Holder classes; and derive lower bounds on their minimax errors. We also analyze two naturally associated trend filtering methods; when $d=2$; each is seen to be rate optimal over the appropriate class.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7162-higher-order-total-variation-classes-on-grids-minimax-theory-and-trend-filtering-methods/bibtex,Veeranjaneyulu Sadhanala; Yu-Xiang Wang; James L.

2017,Clustering with Noisy Queries,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7161-clustering-with-noisy-queries.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7161-clustering-with-noisy-queries,In this paper; we provide a rigorous theoretical study of clustering with noisy queries. Given a set of $n$ elements; our goal is to recover the true clustering by asking minimum number of pairwise queries to an oracle. Oracle can answer queries of the form ``do elements $u$ and $v$ belong to the same cluster?''-the queries can be asked interactively (adaptive queries); or non-adaptively up-front; but its answer can be erroneous with probability $p$. In this paper; we provide the first information theoretic lower bound on the number of queries for clustering with noisy oracle in both situations.  We design novel algorithms that closely match this query complexity lower bound; even when the number of clusters is unknown.  Moreover; we design computationally efficient algorithms both for the adaptive and non-adaptive settings. The problem captures/generalizes multiple application scenarios. It is directly motivated by the growing body of work that use crowdsourcing for {\em entity resolution}; a fundamental and challenging data mining task aimed to identify all records in a database referring to the same entity. Here crowd represents the noisy oracle; and the number of queries directly relates to the cost of crowdsourcing. Another application comes from the problem of sign edge prediction in social network; where social interactions can be both positive and negative; and one must identify the sign of all pair-wise interactions by  querying a few pairs. Furthermore; clustering with noisy oracle is intimately connected to correlation clustering; leading to improvement therein. Finally; it introduces a new direction of study in the popular stochastic block model where one has an incomplete stochastic block model matrix to recover the clusters.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7161-clustering-with-noisy-queries/bibtex,Arya Mazumdar; Barna Saha

Since modern applications give rise to very large problem instances; there is increasing need for efficient solvers. In this work we propose to improve the efficiency of coordinate-minimization-based dual-decomposition solvers by running their updates asynchronously in parallel. In this case message-passing inference is performed by multiple processing units simultaneously without coordination; all reading and writing to shared memory. We analyze the convergence properties of the resulting algorithms and identify settings where speedup gains can be expected. Our numerical evaluations show that this approach indeed achieves significant speedups in common computer vision tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7156-asynchronous-parallel-coordinate-minimization-for-map-inference/bibtex,Ofer Meshi; Alexander Schwing

Standard CVAEs with a fixed Gaussian prior yield descriptions with too little variability. Instead; we propose two models that explicitly structure the latent space around K components corresponding to different types of image content; and combine components to create priors for images that contain multiple types of content simultaneously (e.g.; several kinds of objects). Our first model uses a Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) prior; while the second one defines a novel Additive Gaussian (AG) prior that linearly combines component means. We show that both models produce captions that are more diverse and more accurate than a strong LSTM baseline or a ?vanilla? CVAE with a fixed Gaussian prior; with AG-CVAE showing particular promise.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7158-diverse-and-accurate-image-description-using-a-variational-auto-encoder-with-an-additive-gaussian-encoding-space/bibtex,Liwei Wang; Alexander Schwing; Svetlana Lazebnik

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs; but sometimes can still generate only poor samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic; which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning; including 101-layer ResNets and language models with continuous generators. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7159-improved-training-of-wasserstein-gans/bibtex,Ishaan Gulrajani; Faruk Ahmed; Martin Arjovsky; Vincent Dumoulin; Aaron C.

A collection of spectra is generated at the output of the process; each spectrum of which is representative of a peptide (protein subsequence) present in the original complex sample. In this work; we leverage the log-likelihood gradients of generative models to improve the identification of such spectra. In particular; we show that the gradient of a recently proposed dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) may be naturally employed by a kernel-based discriminative classifier. The resulting Fisher kernel substantially improves upon recent attempts to combine generative and discriminative models for post-processing analysis; outperforming all other methods on the evaluated datasets. We extend the improved accuracy offered by the Fisher kernel framework to other search algorithms by introducing Theseus; a DBN representating a large number of widely used MS/MS scoring functions. Furthermore; with gradient ascent and max-product inference at hand; we use Theseus to learn model parameters without any supervision.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7155-gradients-of-generative-models-for-improved-discriminative-analysis-of-tandem-mass-spectra/bibtex,John T.

2017,Learning Populations of Parameters,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7160-learning-populations-of-parameters.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7160-learning-populations-of-parameters,Consider the following estimation problem: there are $n$ entities; each with an unknown parameter $p_i \in [0;1]$; and we observe $n$ independent random variables; $X_1;\ldots;X_n$; with $X_i \sim $ Binomial$(t; p_i)$.  How accurately can one recover the ``histogram'' (i.e. cumulative density function) of the $p_i$'s?   While the empirical estimates would recover the histogram to earth mover distance $\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})$ (equivalently; $\ell_1$ distance between the CDFs); we show that; provided $n$ is sufficiently large; we can achieve error $O(\frac{1}{t})$ which is information theoretically optimal. We also extend our results to the multi-dimensional parameter case; capturing settings where each member of the population has multiple associated parameters.  Beyond the theoretical results; we demonstrate that the recovery algorithm performs well in practice on a variety of datasets; providing illuminating insights into several domains; including politics; sports analytics; and variation in the gender ratio of offspring.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7160-learning-populations-of-parameters/bibtex,Kevin Tian; Weihao Kong; Gregory Valiant

The key insight of the approach is that quantization methods; in particular product quantization; perform poorly when there is large variance in the norms of the data points. This is a common scenario for real- world datasets; especially when doing product quantization of residuals obtained from coarse vector quantization. To address this issue; we propose a multiscale formulation where we learn a separate scalar quantizer of the residual norm scales. All parameters are learned jointly in a stochastic gradient descent framework to minimize the overall quantization error. We provide theoretical motivation for the proposed technique and conduct comprehensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets; demonstrating substantial improvements in recall over existing state-of-the-art methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7157-multiscale-quantization-for-fast-similarity-search/bibtex,Xiang Wu; Ruiqi Guo; Ananda Theertha Suresh; Sanjiv Kumar; Daniel N.

Current approaches for dimensionality reduction on neural data are limited to single population recordings; and can not identify dynamics embedded across multiple measurements. We propose an approach for extracting low-dimensional dynamics from multiple; sequential recordings. Our algorithm scales to data comprising millions of observed dimensions; making it possible to access dynamics distributed across large populations or multiple brain areas. Building on subspace-identification approaches for dynamical systems; we perform parameter estimation by minimizing a moment-matching objective using a scalable stochastic gradient descent algorithm: The model is optimized to predict temporal covariations across neurons and across time. We show how this approach naturally handles missing data and multiple partial recordings; and can identify dynamics and predict correlations even in the presence of severe subsampling and small overlap between recordings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach both on simulated data and a whole-brain larval zebrafish imaging dataset.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7153-extracting-low-dimensional-dynamics-from-multiple-large-scale-neural-population-recordings-by-learning-to-predict-correlations/bibtex,Marcel Nonnenmacher; Srinivas C.

This paper introduces a new framework for theoretically measuring the performance of such algorithms called Uniform-PAC; which is a strengthening of the classical Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework. In contrast to the PAC framework; the uniform version may be used to derive high probability regret guarantees and so forms a bridge between the two setups that has been missing in the literature. We demonstrate the benefits of the new framework for finite-state episodic MDPs with a new algorithm that is Uniform-PAC and simultaneously achieves optimal regret and PAC guarantees except for a factor of the horizon.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7154-unifying-pac-and-regret-uniform-pac-bounds-for-episodic-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Christoph Dann; Tor Lattimore; Emma Brunskill

This has motivated a growing line of work on what it means for a classification procedure to be "fair." In this paper; we investigate the tension between minimizing error disparity across different population groups while maintaining calibrated probability estimates. We show that calibration is compatible only with a single error constraint (i.e. equal false-negatives rates across groups); and show that any algorithm that satisfies this relaxation is no better than randomizing a percentage of predictions for an existing classifier. These unsettling findings; which extend and generalize existing results; are empirically confirmed on several datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7151-on-fairness-and-calibration/bibtex,Geoff Pleiss; Manish Raghavan; Felix Wu; Jon Kleinberg; Kilian Q.

This allows inherent variation or uncertainty in function-valued data to be properly incorporated in the population analysis. Using the 2-Wasserstein metric we geometrize the space of GPs with L2 mean and covariance functions over compact index spaces. We prove uniqueness of the barycenter of a population of GPs; as well as convergence of the metric and the barycenter of their finite-dimensional counterparts. This justifies practical computations. Finally; we demonstrate our framework through experimental validation on GP datasets representing brain connectivity and climate development.

Recently; the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model has been shown to outperform traditional optical flow based methods for precipitation nowcasting; suggesting that deep learning models have a huge potential for solving the problem. However; the convolutional recurrence structure in ConvLSTM-based models is location-invariant while natural motion and transformation (e.g.; rotation) are location-variant in general. Furthermore; since deep-learning-based precipitation nowcasting is a newly emerging area; clear evaluation protocols have not yet been established. To address these problems; we propose both a new model and a benchmark for precipitation nowcasting. Specifically; we go beyond ConvLSTM and propose the Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU) model that can actively learn the location-variant structure for recurrent connections. Besides; we provide a benchmark that includes a real-world large-scale dataset from the Hong Kong Observatory; a new training loss; and a comprehensive evaluation protocol to facilitate future research and gauge the state of the art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7145-deep-learning-for-precipitation-nowcasting-a-benchmark-and-a-new-model/bibtex,Xingjian Shi; Zhihan Gao; Leonard Lausen; Hao Wang; Dit-Yan Yeung; Wai-kin Wong; Wang-chun WOO

Alpha-investing algorithms to control the false discovery rate were first formulated by Foster and Stine and have since been generalized and applied to various settings; varying from quality-preserving databases for science to multiple A/B tests for internet commerce. This paper improves the class of generalized alpha-investing algorithms (GAI) in four ways : (a) we show how to uniformly improve the power of the entire class of GAI procedures under independence by awarding more alpha-wealth for each rejection; giving a near win-win resolution to a dilemma raised by Javanmard and Montanari; (b) we demonstrate how to incorporate prior weights to indicate domain knowledge of which hypotheses are likely to be null or non-null; (c) we allow for differing penalties for false discoveries to indicate that some hypotheses may be more meaningful/important than others; (d) we define a new quantity called the \emph{decaying memory false discovery rate; or $\memfdr$} that may be more meaningful for applications with an explicit time component; using a discount factor to incrementally forget past decisions and alleviate some potential problems that we describe and name ``piggybacking'' and ``alpha-death''. Our GAI++ algorithms incorporate all four generalizations (a; b; c; d) simulatenously; and reduce to more powerful variants of earlier algorithms when the weights and decay are all set to unity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7148-online-control-of-the-false-discovery-rate-with-decaying-memory/bibtex,Aaditya Ramdas; Fanny Yang; Martin J.

Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand; epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model - uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision; but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further; our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks; which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data; also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7141-what-uncertainties-do-we-need-in-bayesian-deep-learning-for-computer-vision/bibtex,Alex Kendall; Yarin Gal
2017,Learning from Complementary Labels,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7147-learning-from-complementary-labels.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7147-learning-from-complementary-labels,Collecting labeled data is costly and thus a critical bottleneck in real-world classification tasks. To mitigate this problem; we propose a novel setting; namely learning from complementary labels for multi-class classification. A complementary label specifies a class that a pattern does not belong to. Collecting complementary labels would be less laborious than collecting ordinary labels; since users do not have to carefully choose the correct class from a long list of candidate classes. However; complementary labels are less informative than ordinary labels and thus a suitable approach is needed to better learn from them. In this paper; we show that an unbiased estimator to the classification risk can be obtained only from complementarily labeled data; if a loss function satisfies a particular symmetric condition. We derive estimation error bounds for the proposed method and prove that the optimal parametric convergence rate is achieved. We further show that learning from complementary labels can be easily combined with learning from ordinary labels (i.e.; ordinary supervised learning); providing a highly practical implementation of the proposed method. Finally; we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7147-learning-from-complementary-labels/bibtex,Takashi Ishida; Gang Niu; Weihua Hu; Masashi Sugiyama
2017,Do Deep Neural Networks Suffer from Crowding?,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7146-do-deep-neural-networks-suffer-from-crowding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7146-do-deep-neural-networks-suffer-from-crowding,Crowding is a visual effect suffered by humans; in which an object that can be recognized in isolation can no longer be recognized when other objects; called flankers; are placed close to it. In this work; we study the effect of crowding in artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for object recognition. We analyze both deep convolutional neural networks  (DCNNs) as well as an extension of DCNNs that are multi-scale and that change the receptive field size of the convolution filters with their position in the image.  The latter  networks; that we call eccentricity-dependent; have been proposed for modeling the feedforward path of the primate visual cortex. Our results reveal that the eccentricity-dependent model; trained on target objects in isolation; can recognize such targets in the presence of flankers; if the targets are near the center of the image; whereas DCNNs cannot. Also; for all tested networks; when trained on targets in isolation; we find that recognition accuracy of the networks decreases the closer the flankers are to the target and the more flankers there are. We find that visual similarity between the target and flankers also plays a role and that pooling in early layers of the network leads to more crowding. Additionally; we show that incorporating flankers  into the images of the training set for learning the DNNs does not lead to robustness against configurations not seen at training.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7146-do-deep-neural-networks-suffer-from-crowding/bibtex,Anna Volokitin; Gemma Roig; Tomaso A.

2017,Dualing GANs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7144-dualing-gans.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7144-dualing-gans,Generative adversarial nets (GANs) are a promising technique for modeling a distribution from samples. It is however well known that GAN training suffers from instability due to the nature of its saddle point formulation. In this paper; we explore ways to tackle the instability problem by dualizing the discriminator. We start from linear discriminators in which case conjugate duality provides a mechanism to reformulate the saddle point objective into a maximization problem; such that both the generator and the discriminator of this ?dualing GAN? act in concert. We then demonstrate how to extend this intuition to non-linear formulations. For GANs with linear discriminators our approach is able to remove the instability in training; while for GANs with nonlinear discriminators our approach provides an alternative to the commonly used GAN training algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7144-dualing-gans/bibtex,Yujia Li; Alexander Schwing; Kuan-Chieh Wang; Richard Zemel
2017,Toward Robustness against Label Noise in Training Deep Discriminative Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7143-toward-robustness-against-label-noise-in-training-deep-discriminative-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7143-toward-robustness-against-label-noise-in-training-deep-discriminative-neural-networks,Collecting large training datasets; annotated with high-quality labels; is costly and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework for training deep convolutional neural networks from noisy labeled datasets that can be obtained cheaply. The problem is formulated using an undirected graphical model that represents the relationship between noisy and clean labels; trained in a semi-supervised setting. In our formulation; the inference over latent clean labels is tractable and is regularized during training using auxiliary sources of information. The proposed model is applied to the image labeling problem and is shown to be effective in labeling unseen images as well as reducing label noise in training on CIFAR-10 and MS COCO datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7143-toward-robustness-against-label-noise-in-training-deep-discriminative-neural-networks/bibtex,Arash Vahdat
2017,Gradient descent GAN optimization is locally stable,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7142-gradient-descent-gan-optimization-is-locally-stable.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7142-gradient-descent-gan-optimization-is-locally-stable,Despite the growing prominence of generative adversarial   networks (GANs); optimization in GANs is still a poorly understood topic.  In this paper; we analyze   the ``gradient descent'' form of GAN optimization; i.e.; the natural   setting where we simultaneously take small gradient steps in both generator   and discriminator parameters.  We show that even though GAN optimization   does \emph{not}    correspond to a convex-concave game (even for simple parameterizations); under   proper conditions; equilibrium points of this  optimization    procedure are still \emph{locally asymptotically stable} for the traditional   GAN formulation. On the other hand; we show that the recently proposed   Wasserstein GAN can have non-convergent limit cycles near equilibrium.   Motivated by this stability analysis; we    propose an additional regularization term for gradient descent GAN updates;   which \emph{is} able to guarantee local stability for both the WGAN and the   traditional GAN; and also shows practical promise in speeding up   convergence and addressing mode collapse.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7142-gradient-descent-gan-optimization-is-locally-stable/bibtex,Vaishnavh Nagarajan; J.

2017,From Bayesian Sparsity to Gated Recurrent Nets,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7139-from-bayesian-sparsity-to-gated-recurrent-nets.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7139-from-bayesian-sparsity-to-gated-recurrent-nets,The iterations of many first-order algorithms; when applied to minimizing common regularized regression functions; often resemble neural network layers with pre-specified weights.  This observation has prompted the development of learning-based approaches that purport to replace these iterations with enhanced surrogates forged as DNN models from available training data.  For example; important NP-hard sparse estimation problems have recently benefitted from this genre of upgrade; with simple feedforward or recurrent networks ousting proximal gradient-based iterations.  Analogously; this paper demonstrates that more powerful Bayesian algorithms for promoting sparsity; which rely on complex multi-loop majorization-minimization techniques; mirror the structure of more sophisticated long short-term memory (LSTM) networks; or alternative gated feedback networks previously designed for sequence prediction.  As part of this development; we examine the parallels between latent variable trajectories operating across multiple time-scales during optimization; and the activations within deep network structures designed to adaptively model such characteristic sequences.  The resulting insights lead to a novel sparse estimation system that; when granted training data; can estimate optimal solutions efficiently in regimes where other algorithms fail; including practical direction-of-arrival (DOA) and 3D geometry recovery problems.   The underlying principles we expose are also suggestive of a learning process for a richer class of multi-loop algorithms in other domains.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7139-from-bayesian-sparsity-to-gated-recurrent-nets/bibtex,Hao He; Bo Xin; Satoshi Ikehata; David Wipf
2017,Approximation and Convergence Properties of Generative Adversarial Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7138-approximation-and-convergence-properties-of-generative-adversarial-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7138-approximation-and-convergence-properties-of-generative-adversarial-learning,Generative adversarial networks (GAN) approximate a target data distribution by jointly optimizing an objective function through a "two-player game" between a generator and a discriminator.  Despite their empirical success; however; two very basic questions on how well they can approximate the target distribution remain unanswered. First; it is not known how restricting the discriminator family affects the approximation quality. Second; while a number of different objective functions have been proposed; we do not understand when convergence to the global minima of the objective function leads to convergence to the target distribution under various notions of distributional convergence.   In this paper; we address these questions in a broad and unified setting by defining a notion of adversarial divergences that includes a number of recently proposed objective functions. We show that if the objective function is an adversarial divergence with some additional conditions; then using a restricted discriminator family has a moment-matching effect. Additionally; we show that for objective functions that are strict adversarial divergences; convergence in the objective function implies weak convergence; thus generalizing previous results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7138-approximation-and-convergence-properties-of-generative-adversarial-learning/bibtex,Shuang Liu; Olivier Bousquet; Kamalika Chaudhuri
2017,Hierarchical Implicit Models and Likelihood-Free Variational Inference,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7136-hierarchical-implicit-models-and-likelihood-free-variational-inference.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7136-hierarchical-implicit-models-and-likelihood-free-variational-inference,Implicit probabilistic models are a flexible class of models defined by a simulation process for data. They form the basis for models which encompass our understanding of the physical word. Despite this fundamental nature; the use of implicit models remains limited due to challenge in positing complex latent structure in them; and the ability to inference in such models with large data sets. In this paper; we first introduce the hierarchical implicit models (HIMs). HIMs combine the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling thereby defining models via simulators of data with rich hidden structure. Next; we develop likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI); a scalable variational inference algorithm for HIMs. Key to LFVI is specifying a variational family that is also implicit. This matches the model's flexibility and allows for accurate approximation of the posterior. We demonstrate diverse applications: a large-scale physical simulator for predator-prey populations in ecology; a Bayesian generative adversarial network for discrete data; and a deep implicit model for symbol generation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7136-hierarchical-implicit-models-and-likelihood-free-variational-inference/bibtex,Dustin Tran; Rajesh Ranganath; David Blei

What form would such an explanation take; in the face of existing complexity-theoretic lower bounds? A first step might be to show that data generated by neural networks with a single hidden layer; smooth activation functions and benign input distributions can be learned efficiently. We demonstrate here a comprehensive lower bound ruling out this possibility: for a wide class of activation functions (including all currently used); and inputs drawn from any logconcave distribution; there is a family of one-hidden-layer functions whose output is a sum gate that are hard to learn in a precise sense: any statistical query algorithm (which includes all known variants of stochastic gradient descent with any loss function) needs an exponential number of queries even using tolerance inversely proportional to the input dimensionality. Moreover; this hard family of functions is realizable with a small (sublinear in dimension) number of activation units in the single hidden layer. The lower bound is also robust to small perturbations of the true weights. Systematic experiments illustrate a phase transition in the training error as predicted by the analysis.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7135-on-the-complexity-of-learning-neural-networks/bibtex,Le Song; Santosh Vempala; John Wilmes; Bo Xie

Most of these methods use a shared discriminator/classifier which discriminates real examples from fake while also predicting the class label. Motivated by the ability of the GANs generator to capture the data manifold well; we propose to estimate the tangent space to the data manifold using GANs and employ it to inject invariances into the classifier. In the process; we propose enhancements over existing methods for learning the inverse mapping (i.e.; the encoder)  which greatly improves in terms of semantic similarity of the reconstructed sample with the input sample. We observe considerable empirical gains in semi-supervised learning over baselines; particularly in the cases when the number of labeled examples is low. We also provide insights into how fake examples influence the semi-supervised learning procedure.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7137-semi-supervised-learning-with-gans-manifold-invariance-with-improved-inference/bibtex,Abhishek Kumar; Prasanna Sattigeri; Tom Fletcher

However; the criteria by which we train these algorithms often differ from the ultimate criteria on which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for learning probabilistic machine learning models in a manner that directly captures the ultimate task-based objective for which they will be used; within the context of stochastic programming. We present three experimental evaluations of the proposed approach: a classical inventory stock problem; a real-world electrical grid scheduling task; and a real-world energy storage arbitrage task. We show that the proposed approach can outperform both traditional modeling and purely black-box policy optimization approaches in these applications.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7132-task-based-end-to-end-model-learning-in-stochastic-optimization/bibtex,Priya Donti; Brandon Amos; J.

SVD-softmax targets fast and accurate probability estimation of the topmost probable words during inference of neural network language models. The proposed method transforms the weight matrix used in the calculation of the output vector by using SVD. The approximate probability of each word can be estimated with only a small part of the weight matrix by using a few large singular values and the corresponding elements for most of the words. We applied the technique to language modeling and neural machine translation and present a guideline for good approximation. The algorithm requires only approximately 20\% of arithmetic operations for an 800K vocabulary case and shows more than a three-fold speedup on a GPU.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7130-svd-softmax-fast-softmax-approximation-on-large-vocabulary-neural-networks/bibtex,Kyuhong Shim; Minjae Lee; Iksoo Choi; Yoonho Boo; Wonyong Sung
2017,A Greedy Approach for Budgeted Maximum Inner Product Search,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7129-a-greedy-approach-for-budgeted-maximum-inner-product-search.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7129-a-greedy-approach-for-budgeted-maximum-inner-product-search,Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is an important task in many machine learning applications such as the prediction phase of low-rank matrix factorization models and deep learning models. Recently; there has been substantial research on how to perform MIPS in sub-linear time; but most of the existing work does not have the flexibility to control the trade-off between search efficiency and search quality. In this paper; we study the important problem of MIPS with a computational budget. By carefully studying the problem structure of MIPS; we develop a novel Greedy-MIPS algorithm; which can handle budgeted MIPS by design. While simple and intuitive; Greedy-MIPS yields surprisingly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. As a specific example; on a candidate set containing half a million vectors of dimension 200; Greedy-MIPS runs 200x faster than the naive approach while yielding search results with the top-5 precision greater than 75%.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7129-a-greedy-approach-for-budgeted-maximum-inner-product-search/bibtex,Hsiang-Fu Yu; Cho-Jui Hsieh; Qi Lei; Inderjit S.

With a good policy evaluation method; the RL algorithms will estimate the value function more accurately and find a better policy. When the state space is large or continuous \emph{Gradient-based Temporal Difference(GTD)} policy evaluation algorithms with linear function approximation are widely used. Considering that the collection of the evaluation data is both time and reward consuming; a clear understanding of the finite sample performance of the policy evaluation algorithms is very important to reinforcement learning. Under the assumption that data are i.i.d. generated; previous work provided the finite sample analysis of the GTD algorithms with constant step size by converting  them into  convex-concave saddle point problems. However; it is well-known that; the data are generated from Markov processes rather than i.i.d in RL problems.. In this paper; in the realistic Markov setting; we derive the finite sample bounds for the general convex-concave saddle point problems; and hence for the GTD algorithms. We have the following discussions based on our bounds. (1) With variants of step size; GTD algorithms converge. (2) The convergence rate is determined by the step size; with the mixing time of the Markov process as the coefficient. The faster the Markov processes mix; the faster the convergence. (3) We explain that the experience replay trick is effective by improving the mixing property of the Markov process.  To the best of our knowledge; our analysis is the first to provide finite sample bounds for the GTD algorithms in Markov setting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7134-finite-sample-analysis-of-the-gtd-policy-evaluation-algorithms-in-markov-setting/bibtex,Yue Wang; Wei Chen; Yuting Liu; Zhi-Ming Ma; Tie-Yan Liu

Within a framework of conditional entropy; we propose both adversarial and non-adversarial approaches to learn desirable matched joint distributions for unsupervised and supervised tasks. We unify a broad family of adversarial models as joint distribution matching problems. Our approach stabilizes learning of unsupervised bidirectional adversarial learning methods. Further; we introduce an extension for semi-supervised learning tasks.

Recently; coding-theory-inspired approaches have been applied to mitigate the effect of straggling; through embedding redundancy in certain linear computational steps of the optimization algorithm; thus completing the computation without waiting for the stragglers. In this paper; we propose an alternate approach where we embed the redundancy directly in the data itself; and allow the computation to proceed completely oblivious to encoding. We propose several encoding schemes; and demonstrate that popular batch algorithms; such as gradient descent and L-BFGS; applied in a coding-oblivious manner; deterministically achieve sample path linear convergence to an approximate solution of the original problem; using an arbitrarily varying subset of the nodes at each iteration. Moreover; this approximation can be controlled by the amount of redundancy and the number of nodes used in each iteration. We provide experimental results demonstrating the advantage of the approach over uncoded and data replication strategies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7127-straggler-mitigation-in-distributed-optimization-through-data-encoding/bibtex,Can Karakus; Yifan Sun; Suhas Diggavi; Wotao Yin

We develop a model which can plan ahead in the future when it computes its alignments between input and output sequences; constructing a matrix of proposed future alignments and a commitment vector that governs whether to follow or recompute the plan. This mechanism is inspired by the recently proposed strategic attentive reader and writer (STRAW) model for Reinforcement Learning. Our proposed model is end-to-end trainable using primarily differentiable operations. We show that it outperforms a strong baseline on character-level translation tasks from WMT'15; the algorithmic task of finding Eulerian circuits of graphs; and question generation from the text. Our analysis demonstrates that the model computes qualitatively intuitive alignments; converges faster than the baselines; and achieves superior performance with fewer parameters.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7131-plan-attend-generate-planning-for-sequence-to-sequence-models/bibtex,Caglar Gulcehre; Francis Dutil; Adam Trischler; Yoshua Bengio

By committing to play a specific policy; the agent with the correct model can steer the behavior of the other agent; and seek to improve utility. We model this setting as a multi-view decision process; which we use to formally analyze the positive effect of steering policies. Furthermore; we develop an algorithm for computing the agents' achievable joint policy; and we experimentally show that it can lead to a large utility increase when the agents' models diverge.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7128-multi-view-decision-processes-the-helper-ai-problem/bibtex,Christos Dimitrakakis; David C.

However; they are notoriously hard to train and can suffer from the problem of missing modes where the model is not able to produce examples in certain regions of the space. We propose an iterative procedure; called AdaGAN; where at every step we add a new component into a mixture model by running a GAN algorithm on a re-weighted sample. This is inspired by boosting algorithms; where many potentially weak individual predictors are greedily aggregated to form a strong composite predictor. We prove analytically that such an incremental procedure leads to convergence to the true distribution in a finite number of steps if each step is optimal; and convergence at an exponential rate otherwise. We also illustrate experimentally that this procedure addresses the problem of missing modes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7126-adagan-boosting-generative-models/bibtex,Ilya O.

Classifier chains are a state-of-the-art method for tackling such problems; which essentially converts this problem into a sequential prediction problem; where the labels are first ordered in an arbitrary fashion; and the task is to predict a sequence of binary values for these labels. In this paper; we replace classifier chains with recurrent neural networks; a sequence-to-sequence prediction algorithm which has recently been successfully applied to sequential prediction tasks in many domains. The key advantage of this approach is that it allows to focus on the prediction of the positive labels only; a much smaller set than the full set of possible labels. Moreover; parameter sharing across all classifiers allows to better exploit information of previous decisions. As both; classifier chains and recurrent neural networks depend on a fixed ordering of the labels; which is typically not part of a multi-label problem specification; we also compare different ways of ordering the label set; and give some recommendations on suitable ordering strategies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7125-maximizing-subset-accuracy-with-recurrent-neural-networks-in-multi-label-classification/bibtex,Jinseok Nam; Eneldo Loza Menc?a; Hyunwoo J.

In particular; it focuses on A- and E-optimal designs; for which typical guarantees do not apply since the mean-square error and the maximum eigenvalue of the estimation error covariance matrix are not supermodular. To do so; it leverages the concept of approximate supermodularity to derive non-asymptotic worst-case suboptimality bounds for these greedy solutions. These bounds reveal that as the SNR of the experiments decreases; these cost functions behave increasingly as supermodular functions. As such; greedy A- and E-optimal designs approach (1-1/e)-optimality. These results reconcile the empirical success of greedy experimental design with the non-supermodularity of the A- and E-optimality criteria.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7124-approximate-supermodularity-bounds-for-experimental-design/bibtex,Luiz Chamon; Alejandro Ribeiro

In typical deep RL methods this is achieved by approximating the optimal value function with a low-dimensional representation using a deep network.  While this approach works well in many domains; in domains where the optimal value function cannot easily be reduced to a low-dimensional representation; learning can be very slow and unstable. This paper contributes towards tackling such challenging domains; by proposing a new method; called Hybrid Reward Architecture (HRA). HRA takes as input a decomposed reward function and learns a separate value function for each component reward function. Because each component typically only depends on a subset of all features; the corresponding value function can be approximated more easily by a low-dimensional representation; enabling more effective learning. We demonstrate HRA on a toy-problem and the Atari game Ms. Pac-Man; where HRA achieves above-human performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7123-hybrid-reward-architecture-for-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Harm Van Seijen; Mehdi Fatemi; Joshua Romoff; Romain Laroche; Tavian Barnes; Jeffrey Tsang

For any hypothesis $H$ and for any sample $S$ of size $m$; the split-sample growth rate $\hat{\tau}_H(m)$ counts how many different hypotheses can empirical risk minimization output on any sub-sample of $S$ of size $m/2$. We show that the expected generalization error is upper bounded by $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log(\hat{\tau}_H(2m))}{m}}\right)$. Our result is enabled by a strengthening of the Rademacher complexity analysis of the expected generalization error. We show that this sample complexity measure; greatly simplifies the analysis of the sample complexity of optimal auction design; for many auction classes studied in the literature. Their sample complexity can be derived solely by noticing that in these auction classes; ERM on any sample or sub-sample will pick parameters that are equal to one of the points in the sample.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7119-a-sample-complexity-measure-with-applications-to-learning-optimal-auctions/bibtex,Vasilis Syrgkanis

The algorithm is widely known to be too greedy; but nevertheless enjoys wide use due to its simplicity and ability to handle uncertainty and noise in a coherent decision theoretic framework. To provide rigorous insight into EI; we study its properties in a simple setting of Bayesian optimization where the domain consists of a finite grid of points. This is the so-called best-arm identification problem; where the goal is to allocate measurement effort wisely to confidently identify the best arm using a small number of measurements. In this framework; one can show formally that EI is far from optimal. To overcome this shortcoming; we introduce a simple modification of the expected improvement algorithm. Surprisingly; this simple change results in an algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for Gaussian best-arm identification problems; and provably outperforms standard EI by an order of magnitude.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7122-improving-the-expected-improvement-algorithm/bibtex,Chao Qin; Diego Klabjan; Daniel Russo

One bottleneck of centralized algorithms lies on high communication cost on the central node. Motivated by this; we ask; can decentralized algorithms be faster than its centralized counterpart?  Although decentralized PSGD (D-PSGD) algorithms have been studied by the control community; existing analysis and theory do not show any advantage over centralized PSGD (C-PSGD) algorithms; simply assuming the application scenario where only the decentralized network is available. In this paper; we study a D-PSGD algorithm and provide the first theoretical analysis that indicates a regime in which decentralized algorithms might outperform centralized algorithms for distributed stochastic gradient descent. This is because D-PSGD has comparable total computational complexities to C-PSGD but requires much less communication cost on the busiest node. We further conduct an empirical study to validate our theoretical analysis across multiple frameworks (CNTK and Torch); different network configurations; and computation platforms up to 112 GPUs. On network configurations with low bandwidth or high latency; D-PSGD can be up to one order of magnitude faster than its well-optimized centralized counterparts.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7117-can-decentralized-algorithms-outperform-centralized-algorithms-a-case-study-for-decentralized-parallel-stochastic-gradient-descent/bibtex,Xiangru Lian; Ce Zhang; Huan Zhang; Cho-Jui Hsieh; Wei Zhang; Ji Liu

Specifically; we describe a factor-graph-based model with customized factor-functions defined based on domain knowledge; to infer pathologic brain activity with the goal of identifying seizure-generating brain regions in epilepsy patients. We utilize an inference technique based on the graph-cut algorithm to exactly solve graph inference in polynomial time. We validate the model by using clinically collected intracranial EEG data from 29 epilepsy patients to show that the model correctly identifies seizure-generating brain regions. Our results indicate that our model outperforms two conventional approaches used for seizure-onset localization (5-7% better AUC: 0.72; 0.67; 0.65) and that the proposed inference technique provides 3-10% gain in AUC (0.72; 0.62; 0.69) compared to sampling-based alternatives.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7121-eeg-graph-a-factor-graph-based-model-for-capturing-spatial-temporal-and-observational-relationships-in-electroencephalograms/bibtex,Yogatheesan Varatharajah; Min Jin Chong; Krishnakant Saboo; Brent Berry; Benjamin Brinkmann; Gregory Worrell; Ravishankar Iyer
2017,Identification of Gaussian Process State Space Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7115-identification-of-gaussian-process-state-space-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7115-identification-of-gaussian-process-state-space-models,The Gaussian process state space model (GPSSM) is a non-linear dynamical system; where unknown transition and/or measurement mappings are described by GPs. Most research in GPSSMs has focussed on the state estimation problem; i.e.; computing a posterior of the latent state given the model. However; the key challenge in GPSSMs has not been satisfactorily addressed yet: system identification; i.e.; learning the model. To address this challenge; we impose a structured Gaussian variational posterior distribution over the latent states; which is parameterised by a recognition model in the form of a bi-directional recurrent neural network. Inference with this structure allows us to recover a posterior smoothed over sequences of data. We provide a practical algorithm for efficiently computing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using the reparameterisation trick. This further allows for the use of arbitrary kernels within the GPSSM. We demonstrate that the learnt GPSSM can efficiently generate plausible future trajectories of the identified system after only observing a small number of episodes from the true system.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7115-identification-of-gaussian-process-state-space-models/bibtex,Stefanos Eleftheriadis; Tom Nicholson; Marc Deisenroth; James Hensman
2017,Thinking Fast and Slow with Deep Learning and Tree Search,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7120-thinking-fast-and-slow-with-deep-learning-and-tree-search.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7120-thinking-fast-and-slow-with-deep-learning-and-tree-search,Sequential decision making problems; such as structured prediction; robotic control; and game playing; require a combination of planning policies and generalisation of those plans. In this paper; we present Expert Iteration (ExIt); a novel reinforcement learning algorithm which decomposes the problem into separate planning and generalisation tasks. Planning new policies is performed by tree search; while a deep neural network generalises those plans. Subsequently; tree search is improved by using the neural network policy to guide search; increasing the strength of new plans. In contrast; standard deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms rely on a neural network not only to generalise plans; but to discover them too. We show that ExIt outperforms REINFORCE for training a neural network to play the board game Hex; and our final tree search agent; trained tabula rasa; defeats MoHex1.0; the most recent Olympiad Champion player to be publicly released.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7120-thinking-fast-and-slow-with-deep-learning-and-tree-search/bibtex,Thomas Anthony; Zheng Tian; David Barber

We focus on learning local aggregative games; where the payoff of each player is a function of its own action and the aggregate behavior of its neighbors in a connected digraph. We show the existence of a pure strategy epsilon-Nash equilibrium in such games when the payoff functions are convex or sub-modular. We prove an information theoretic lower bound; in a value oracle model; on approximating the structure of the digraph with non-negative monotone sub-modular cost functions on the edge set cardinality. We also introduce gamma-aggregative games that generalize local aggregative games; and admit epsilon-Nash equilibrium that are stable with respect to small changes in some specified graph property. Moreover; we provide estimation algorithms for the game theoretic model that can meaningfully recover the underlying structure and payoff functions from real voting data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7118-local-aggregative-games/bibtex,Vikas Garg; Tommi Jaakkola

We exploit the impact of the prior distribution in mitigating the influence of individual data points. In particular; we focus on sampling from an exponential family and specific generalized linear models; such as logistic regression. We propose novel RDP mechanisms as well as offering a new RDP analysis for an existing method in order to add value to the RDP framework. Each method is capable of achieving arbitrary RDP privacy guarantees; and we offer experimental results of their efficacy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7113-renyi-differential-privacy-mechanisms-for-posterior-sampling/bibtex,Joseph Geumlek; Shuang Song; Kamalika Chaudhuri
2017,Robust Imitation of Diverse Behaviors,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7116-robust-imitation-of-diverse-behaviors.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7116-robust-imitation-of-diverse-behaviors,Deep generative models have recently shown great promise in imitation learning for motor control. Given enough data; even supervised approaches can do one-shot imitation learning; however; they are vulnerable to cascading failures when the agent trajectory diverges from the demonstrations. Compared to purely supervised methods; Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) can learn more robust controllers from fewer demonstrations; but is inherently mode-seeking and more difficult to train. In this paper; we show how to combine the favourable aspects of these two approaches. The base of our model is a new type of variational autoencoder on demonstration trajectories that learns semantic policy embeddings. We show that these embeddings can be learned on a 9 DoF Jaco robot arm in reaching tasks; and then smoothly interpolated with a resulting smooth interpolation of reaching behavior. Leveraging these policy representations; we develop a new version of GAIL that (1) is much more robust than the purely-supervised controller; especially with few demonstrations; and (2) avoids mode collapse; capturing many diverse behaviors when GAIL on its own does not. We demonstrate our approach on learning diverse gaits from demonstration on a 2D biped and a 62 DoF 3D humanoid in the MuJoCo physics environment.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7116-robust-imitation-of-diverse-behaviors/bibtex,Ziyu Wang; Josh S.

The hint is given in the form of a vector that is weakly correlated with the loss vector on that round. We show that the player can benefit from such a hint if the set of feasible actions is sufficiently round. Specifically; if the set is strongly convex; the hint can be used to guarantee a regret of O(log(T)); and if the set is q-uniformly convex for q\in(2;3); the hint can be used to guarantee a regret of o(sqrt{T}). In contrast; we establish Omega(sqrt{T}) lower bounds on regret when the set of feasible actions is a polyhedron.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7114-online-learning-with-a-hint/bibtex,Ofer Dekel; arthur flajolet; Nika Haghtalab; Patrick Jaillet

We extend the framework of natural policy gradient and propose to optimize both the actor and the critic using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) with trust region; hence we call our method Actor Critic using Kronecker-Factored Trust Region (ACKTR). To the best of our knowledge; this is the first scalable trust region natural gradient method for actor-critic methods. It is also the method that learns non-trivial tasks in continuous control as well as discrete control policies directly from raw pixel inputs. We tested our approach across discrete domains in Atari games as well as continuous domains in the MuJoCo environment. With the proposed methods; we are able to achieve higher rewards and a 2- to 3-fold improvement in sample efficiency on average; compared to previous state-of-the-art on-policy actor-critic methods.

We show how transductive regret generalizes existing notions of regret; including: (1) external regret; (2) internal regret; (3) swap regret; and (4) conditional swap regret. We present a general and efficient online learning algorithm for minimizing transductive regret. We further extend that to design efficient algorithms for the time-selection and sleeping expert settings. A by-product of our study is an algorithm for swap regret; which; under mild assumptions; is more efficient than existing ones; and a substantially more efficient algorithm for time selection swap regret.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7106-online-learning-with-transductive-regret/bibtex,Mehryar Mohri; Scott Yang

The generators are designed to learn the two-way conditional distributions between the two domains; while the discriminators implicitly define a ternary discriminative function; which is trained to distinguish real data pairs and two kinds of fake data pairs. The generators and discriminators are trained together using adversarial learning. Under mild assumptions; in theory the joint distributions characterized by the two generators concentrate to the data distribution.  In experiments; three different kinds of domain pairs are considered; image-label; image-image and image-attribute pairs. Experiments on semi-supervised image classification; image-to-image translation and attribute-based image generation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7109-triangle-generative-adversarial-networks/bibtex,Zhe Gan; Liqun Chen; Weiyao Wang; Yuchen Pu; Yizhe Zhang; Hao Liu; Chunyuan Li; Lawrence Carin

However; unlike most optimization methods; Bayesian optimization typically does not use derivative information. In this paper we show how Bayesian optimization can exploit derivative information to find good solutions with fewer objective function evaluations. In particular; we develop a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm; the derivative-enabled knowledge-gradient (dKG); which is one-step Bayes-optimal; asymptotically consistent; and provides greater one-step value of information than in the derivative-free setting. dKG accommodates noisy and incomplete derivative information; comes in both sequential and batch forms; and can optionally reduce the computational cost of inference through automatically selected retention of a single directional derivative. We also compute the dKG acquisition function and its gradient using a novel fast discretization-free technique. We show dKG provides state-of-the-art performance compared to a wide range of optimization procedures with and without gradients; on benchmarks including logistic regression; deep learning; kernel learning; and k-nearest neighbors.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7111-bayesian-optimization-with-gradients/bibtex,Jian Wu; Matthias Poloczek; Andrew G.

2017,Identifying Outlier Arms in Multi-Armed Bandit,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7105-identifying-outlier-arms-in-multi-armed-bandit.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7105-identifying-outlier-arms-in-multi-armed-bandit,We study a novel problem lying at the intersection of two areas: multi-armed bandit and outlier detection. Multi-armed bandit is a useful tool to model the process of incrementally collecting data for multiple objects in a decision space. Outlier detection is a powerful method to narrow down the attention to a few objects after the data for them are collected. However; no one has studied how to detect outlier objects while incrementally collecting data for them; which is necessary when data collection is expensive. We formalize this problem as identifying outlier arms in a multi-armed bandit. We propose two sampling strategies with theoretical guarantee; and analyze their sampling efficiency. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that our solution saves 70-99% of data collection cost from baseline while having nearly perfect accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7105-identifying-outlier-arms-in-multi-armed-bandit/bibtex,Honglei Zhuang; Chi Wang; Yifan Wang

The space of weight vectors in the BN layer can be naturally interpreted as a Riemannian manifold; which is invariant to linear scaling of weights. Following the intrinsic geometry of this manifold provides a new learning rule that is more efficient and easier to analyze. We also propose intuitive and effective gradient clipping and regularization methods for the proposed algorithm by utilizing the geometry of the manifold. The resulting algorithm consistently outperforms the original BN on various types of network architectures and datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7107-riemannian-approach-to-batch-normalization/bibtex,Minhyung Cho; Jaehyung Lee

A multi-task Siamese neural network structure is formulated to connect embedding vectors and our objective to preserve the global node ranking and local proximity of nodes. We provide deeper analysis to connect the proposed proximity objective to link prediction and community detection in the network. We show our model can satisfy the following design properties: scalability; asymmetry; unity and simplicity. Experiment results not only verify the above design properties but also demonstrate the superior performance in learning-to-rank; classification; regression; and link prediction tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7110-prune-preserving-proximity-and-global-ranking-for-network-embedding/bibtex,Yi-An Lai; Chin-Chi Hsu; Wen Hao Chen; Mi-Yen Yeh; Shou-De Lin
2017,Self-supervised Learning of Motion Capture,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7108-self-supervised-learning-of-motion-capture.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7108-self-supervised-learning-of-motion-capture,Current state-of-the-art solutions for motion capture from a single camera are optimization driven: they optimize the parameters of a 3D human model so that its re-projection matches measurements in the video (e.g. person segmentation; optical flow; keypoint detections etc.). Optimization models are susceptible to local minima. This has been the bottleneck that forced using clean green-screen like backgrounds at capture time; manual initialization; or switching to multiple cameras as input resource. In this work; we propose a learning based motion capture model for single camera input. Instead of optimizing mesh and skeleton parameters directly; our model optimizes neural network weights that predict 3D shape and skeleton configurations given a monocular RGB video. Our model is trained using a combination of strong supervision from synthetic data; and self-supervision from differentiable rendering of (a) skeletal keypoints; (b) dense 3D mesh motion; and (c) human-background segmentation; in an end-to-end framework. Empirically we show our model combines the best of both worlds of supervised learning and test-time optimization: supervised learning initializes the model parameters in the right regime; ensuring good pose and surface initialization at test time; without manual effort. Self-supervision by back-propagating through differentiable rendering allows (unsupervised) adaptation of the model to the test data; and offers much tighter fit than a pretrained fixed model. We show that the proposed model improves with experience and converges to low-error solutions where previous optimization methods fail.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7108-self-supervised-learning-of-motion-capture/bibtex,Hsiao-Yu Tung; Hsiao-Wei Tung; Ersin Yumer; Katerina Fragkiadaki

(2001). This finding; along with the similarity between the Voronoi iteration algorithm and Lloyd's K-means algorithm; motivates us to use CLARANS as a K-means initializer. We show that CLARANS outperforms other algorithms on 23/23 datasets with a mean decrease over k-means++ of 30% for initialization mean squared error (MSE) and 3% for final MSE. We introduce algorithmic improvements to CLARANS which improve its complexity and runtime; making it a viable initialization scheme for large datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7104-k-medoids-for-k-means-seeding/bibtex,James Newling; Fran?ois Fleuret

While sparse variational Gaussian process models are capable of learning from large-scale data; standard strategies for sparsifying the model can prevent the approximation of complex functions. In this work; we propose a novel variational Gaussian process model that decouples the representation of mean and covariance functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that this new parametrization generalizes previous models. Furthermore; it yields a variational inference problem that can be solved by stochastic gradient ascent with time and space complexity that is only linear in the number of mean function parameters; regardless of the choice of kernels; likelihoods; and inducing points. This strategy makes the adoption of large-scale expressive Gaussian process models possible. We run several experiments on regression tasks and show that this decoupled approach greatly outperforms previous sparse variational Gaussian process inference procedures.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7103-variational-inference-for-gaussian-process-models-with-linear-complexity/bibtex,Ching-An Cheng; Byron Boots

Central to models of human visual attention is the saliency map. We propose a hierarchical visual architecture that operates on a saliency map and uses a novel attention mechanism to sequentially focus on salient regions and take additional glimpses within those regions. The architecture is motivated by human visual attention; and is used for multi-label image classification on a novel multiset task; demonstrating that it achieves high precision and recall while localizing objects with its attention. Unlike conventional multi-label image classification models; the model supports multiset prediction due to a reinforcement-learning based training process that allows for arbitrary label permutation and multiple instances per label.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7102-saliency-based-sequential-image-attention-with-multiset-prediction/bibtex,Sean Welleck; Jialin Mao; Kyunghyun Cho; Zheng Zhang

The goal for the advertiser is to maximize the total utility (e.g. the total number of clicks) derived from displaying ads given that a limited budget $B$ is allocated for a given time horizon $T$. Optimizing the bids is modeled as a contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with a knapsack constraint and a continuum of arms. We develop UCB-type algorithms that combine two streams of literature: the confidence-set approach to linear contextual MABs and the probabilistic bisection search method for stochastic root-finding. Under mild assumptions on the underlying unknown distribution; we establish distribution-independent regret bounds of order $\tilde{O}(d \cdot \sqrt{T})$ when either $B = \infty$ or when $B$ scales linearly with $T$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7101-real-time-bidding-with-side-information/bibtex,arthur flajolet; Patrick Jaillet

To handle intractable inference; research in this area has developed new approximation methods that are fast and effective. However; theoretical analysis of the performance of such approximations is not well developed. The paper furthers such analysis by providing bounds on the excess risk of variational inference algorithms and related regularized loss minimization algorithms for a large class of latent variable models with Gaussian latent variables. We strengthen previous results for variational algorithms by showing they are competitive with any point-estimate predictor. Unlike previous work; we also provide bounds on the risk of the \emph{Bayesian} predictor and not just the risk of the Gibbs predictor for the same approximate posterior. The bounds are applied in complex models including sparse Gaussian processes and correlated topic models. Theoretical results are complemented by identifying novel approximations to the Bayesian objective that attempt to minimize the risk directly. An empirical evaluation compares the variational and new algorithms shedding further light on their performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7100-excess-risk-bounds-for-the-bayes-risk-using-variational-inference-in-latent-gaussian-models/bibtex,Rishit Sheth; Roni Khardon

We propose A-NICE-MC; a novel method to train flexible parametric Markov chain kernels to produce samples with desired properties.   First; we propose an efficient likelihood-free adversarial training method to train a Markov chain and mimic a given data distribution. Then; we leverage flexible volume preserving flows to obtain parametric kernels for MCMC. Using a bootstrap approach; we show how to train efficient Markov Chains to sample from a prescribed posterior distribution by iteratively improving the quality of both the model and the samples. A-NICE-MC provides the first framework to automatically design efficient domain-specific MCMC proposals. Empirical results demonstrate that A-NICE-MC combines the strong guarantees of MCMC with the expressiveness of deep neural networks; and is able to significantly outperform competing methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7099-a-nice-mc-adversarial-training-for-mcmc/bibtex,Jiaming Song; Shengjia Zhao; Stefano Ermon

EP learns vector representations of graphs by passing two types of messages between neighboring nodes. Forward messages consist of label representations such as representations of words and other attributes associated with the nodes. Backward messages consist of gradients that result from aggregating the label representations and applying a reconstruction loss. Node representations are finally computed from the representation of their labels. With significantly fewer parameters and hyperparameters; an instance of EP is competitive with and often outperforms state of the art unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods on a range of benchmark data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7097-learning-graph-representations-with-embedding-propagation/bibtex,Alberto Garcia Duran; Mathias Niepert

How could we build a model that captures the latent information related to  these conditions and generalize to a new one with few data? We present a new model called Latent Variable Multiple Output Gaussian Processes (LVMOGP) that allows to jointly model multiple conditions for regression and generalize to a new condition with a few data points at test time. LVMOGP infers the posteriors of Gaussian processes together with a latent space representing the information about different conditions. We derive an efficient variational inference method for LVMOGP for which the computational complexity is as low as sparse Gaussian processes. We show that LVMOGP significantly outperforms related Gaussian process methods on various tasks with both synthetic and real data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7098-efficient-modeling-of-latent-information-in-supervised-learning-using-gaussian-processes/bibtex,Zhenwen Dai; Mauricio A. ?lvarez; Neil Lawrence
2017,GibbsNet: Iterative Adversarial Inference for Deep Graphical Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7094-gibbsnet-iterative-adversarial-inference-for-deep-graphical-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7094-gibbsnet-iterative-adversarial-inference-for-deep-graphical-models,Directed latent variable models that formulate the joint distribution as $p(x;z) = p(z) p(x \mid z)$ have the advantage of fast and exact sampling. However; these models have the weakness of needing to specify $p(z)$; often with a simple fixed prior that limits the expressiveness of the model.  Undirected latent variable models discard the requirement that $p(z)$ be specified with a prior; yet sampling from them generally requires an iterative procedure such as blocked Gibbs-sampling that may require many steps to draw samples from the joint distribution $p(x; z)$.  We propose a novel approach to learning the joint distribution between the data and a latent code which uses an adversarially learned iterative procedure to gradually refine the joint distribution; $p(x; z)$; to better match with the data distribution on each step.  GibbsNet is the best of both worlds both in theory and in practice.  Achieving the speed and simplicity of a directed latent variable model; it is guaranteed (assuming the adversarial game reaches the virtual training criteria global minimum) to produce samples from $p(x; z)$ with only a few sampling iterations.  Achieving the expressiveness and flexibility of an undirected latent variable model; GibbsNet does away with the need for an explicit $p(z)$ and has the ability to do attribute prediction; class-conditional generation; and joint image-attribute modeling in a single model which is not trained for any of these specific tasks.  We show empirically that GibbsNet is able to learn a more complex $p(z)$ and show that this leads to improved inpainting and iterative refinement of $p(x; z)$ for dozens of steps and stable generation without collapse for thousands of steps; despite being trained on only a few steps.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7094-gibbsnet-iterative-adversarial-inference-for-deep-graphical-models/bibtex,Alex M.

2017,Perturbative Black Box Variational Inference,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7093-perturbative-black-box-variational-inference.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7093-perturbative-black-box-variational-inference,Black box variational inference (BBVI) with reparameterization gradients triggered the exploration of divergence measures other than the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence; such as alpha divergences. In this paper; we view BBVI with generalized divergences as a form of estimating the marginal likelihood via biased importance sampling. The choice of divergence determines a bias-variance trade-off between the tightness of a bound on the marginal likelihood (low bias) and the variance of its gradient estimators. Drawing on variational perturbation theory of statistical physics; we use these insights to construct a family of new variational bounds. Enumerated by an odd integer order $K$; this family captures the standard KL bound for $K=1$; and converges to the exact marginal likelihood as $K\to\infty$. Compared to alpha-divergences; our reparameterization gradients have a lower variance. We show in experiments on Gaussian Processes and Variational Autoencoders that the new bounds are more mass covering; and that the resulting posterior covariances are closer to the true posterior and lead to higher likelihoods on held-out data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7093-perturbative-black-box-variational-inference/bibtex,Robert Bamler; Cheng Zhang; Manfred Opper; Stephan Mandt
2017,Regularizing Deep Neural Networks by Noise: Its Interpretation and Optimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7096-regularizing-deep-neural-networks-by-noise-its-interpretation-and-optimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7096-regularizing-deep-neural-networks-by-noise-its-interpretation-and-optimization,Overfitting is one of the most critical challenges in deep neural networks; and there are various types of regularization methods to improve generalization performance. Injecting noises to hidden units during training; e.g.; dropout; is known as a successful regularizer; but it is still not clear enough why such training techniques work well in practice and how we can maximize their benefit in the presence of two conflicting objectives---optimizing to true data distribution and preventing overfitting by regularization. This paper addresses the above issues by 1) interpreting that the conventional training methods with regularization by noise injection optimize the lower bound of the true objective and 2) proposing a technique to achieve a tighter lower bound using multiple noise samples per training example  in a stochastic gradient descent iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our idea in several computer vision applications.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7096-regularizing-deep-neural-networks-by-noise-its-interpretation-and-optimization/bibtex,Hyeonwoo Noh; Tackgeun You; Jonghwan Mun; Bohyung Han
2017,Polynomial time algorithms for dual volume sampling,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7089-polynomial-time-algorithms-for-dual-volume-sampling.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7089-polynomial-time-algorithms-for-dual-volume-sampling,We study dual volume sampling; a method for selecting k columns from an n*m short and wide matrix (n <= k <= m) such that the probability of selection is proportional to the volume spanned by the rows of the induced submatrix. This method was proposed by Avron and Boutsidis (2013); who showed it to be a promising method for column subset selection and its multiple applications. However; its wider adoption has been hampered by the lack of polynomial time sampling algorithms. We remove this hindrance by developing an exact (randomized) polynomial time sampling algorithm as well as its derandomization. Thereafter; we study dual volume sampling via the theory of real stable polynomials and prove that its distribution satisfies the ?Strong Rayleigh? property. This result has numerous consequences; including a provably fast-mixing Markov chain sampler that makes dual volume sampling much more attractive to practitioners. This sampler is closely related to classical algorithms for popular experimental design methods that are to date lacking theoretical analysis but are known to empirically work well.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7089-polynomial-time-algorithms-for-dual-volume-sampling/bibtex,Chengtao Li; Stefanie Jegelka; Suvrit Sra
2017,Active Exploration for Learning Symbolic Representations,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7086-active-exploration-for-learning-symbolic-representations.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7086-active-exploration-for-learning-symbolic-representations,We introduce an online active exploration algorithm for data-efficiently learning an abstract symbolic model of an environment. Our algorithm is divided into two parts: the first part quickly generates an intermediate Bayesian symbolic model from the data that the agent has collected so far; which the agent can then use along with the second part to guide its future exploration towards regions of the state space that the model is uncertain about. We show that our algorithm outperforms random and greedy exploration policies on two different computer game domains. The first domain is an Asteroids-inspired game with complex dynamics but basic logical structure. The second is the Treasure Game; with simpler dynamics but more complex logical structure.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7086-active-exploration-for-learning-symbolic-representations/bibtex,Garrett Andersen; George Konidaris

It is thus critical to enable algorithms to learn from and be guided by non-expert users. In this paper; we bring a human in the loop; and enable a human teacher to give feedback to a learning agent in the form of natural language. A descriptive sentence can provide a stronger learning signal than a numeric reward in that it can easily point to where the mistakes are and how to correct them. We focus on the problem of image captioning in which the quality of the output can easily be judged by non-experts.  We propose a phrase-based captioning model trained with policy gradients; and design a critic that provides reward to the learner by conditioning on the human-provided feedback. We show  that by exploiting descriptive feedback our model learns to perform better than when given independently written human captions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7092-teaching-machines-to-describe-images-with-natural-language-feedback/bibtex,huan ling; Sanja Fidler

Similarly to Hogwild methods; our approach does not target the original Gaussian distribution of interest; but an approximation to it. Contrary to Hogwild methods; a single parameter allows us to trade bias for variance. We show empirically that our method is very flexible and performs well compared to Hogwild-type algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7087-clone-mcmc-parallel-high-dimensional-gaussian-gibbs-sampling/bibtex,Andrei-Cristian Barbos; Francois Caron; Jean-Fran?ois Giovannelli; Arnaud Doucet

PointNet is a pioneer in this direction. However; by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in; limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work; we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances; our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities; which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities; we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular; results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7095-pointnet-deep-hierarchical-feature-learning-on-point-sets-in-a-metric-space/bibtex,Charles Ruizhongtai Qi; Li Yi; Hao Su; Leonidas J.

Algorithms that focus on the former problem hitherto achieved $O(\sqrt{T})$ in the stochastic setting rather than $O(\log(T))$. Here we introduce an online optimization algorithm that achieves $O(\log^4(T))$ regret in a wide class of stochastic settings while gracefully degrading to the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial settings (up to logarithmic factors). Our algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the data or tuning of parameters to achieve superior performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7091-stochastic-and-adversarial-online-learning-without-hyperparameters/bibtex,Ashok Cutkosky; Kwabena A.

2017,Hindsight Experience Replay,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7090-hindsight-experience-replay.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7090-hindsight-experience-replay,Dealing with sparse rewards is one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum. We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular; we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing; sliding; and pick-and-place; in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed. Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training possible in these challenging environments. We show that our policies trained on a physics simulation can be deployed on a physical robot and successfully complete the task.

We formulate the fair clustering problem under both the k-center and the k-median objectives; and show that even with two protected classes the problem is challenging; as the optimum solution can violate common conventions---for instance a point may no longer be assigned to its nearest cluster center!  En route we introduce the concept of fairlets; which are minimal sets that satisfy fair representation while approximately preserving the clustering objective.  We show that any fair clustering problem can be decomposed into first finding good fairlets; and then using existing machinery for traditional clustering algorithms.  While finding good fairlets can be NP-hard; we proceed to obtain efficient approximation algorithms based on minimum cost flow.  We empirically demonstrate the \emph{price of fairness} by quantifying the value of fair clustering on real-world datasets with sensitive attributes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7088-fair-clustering-through-fairlets/bibtex,Flavio Chierichetti; Ravi Kumar; Silvio Lattanzi; Sergei Vassilvitskii
2017,Online Reinforcement Learning in Stochastic Games,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7084-online-reinforcement-learning-in-stochastic-games.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7084-online-reinforcement-learning-in-stochastic-games,We study online reinforcement learning in average-reward stochastic games (SGs). An SG models a two-player zero-sum game in a Markov environment; where state transitions and one-step payoffs are determined simultaneously by a learner and an adversary. We propose the \textsc{UCSG} algorithm that achieves a sublinear regret compared to the game value when competing with an arbitrary opponent. This result improves previous ones under the same setting. The regret bound has a dependency on the \textit{diameter}; which is an intrinsic value related to the mixing property of SGs. Slightly extended; \textsc{UCSG} finds an $\varepsilon$-maximin stationary policy with a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)\right)$; where $\varepsilon$ is the error parameter. To the best of our knowledge; this extended result is the first in the average-reward setting. In the analysis; we develop Markov chain's perturbation bounds for mean first passage times and techniques to deal with non-stationary opponents; which may be of interest in their own right.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7084-online-reinforcement-learning-in-stochastic-games/bibtex,Chen-Yu Wei; Yi-Te Hong; Chi-Jen Lu

However; typical deep reinforcement learning algorithms seldom provide such information due to their black-box nature. In this paper; we present a probabilistic model; Q-LDA; to uncover latent patterns in text-based sequential decision processes. The model can be understood as a variant of latent topic models that are tailored to maximize total rewards; we further draw an interesting connection between an approximate maximum-likelihood estimation of Q-LDA and the celebrated Q-learning algorithm.  We demonstrate in the text-game domain that our proposed method not only provides a viable mechanism to uncover latent patterns in decision processes; but also obtains state-of-the-art rewards in these games.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7083-q-lda-uncovering-latent-patterns-in-text-based-sequential-decision-processes/bibtex,Jianshu Chen; Chong Wang; Lin Xiao; Ji He; Lihong Li; Li Deng

We characterize the hardness of the problem by deriving an asymptotic regret bound. We propose the Permutation Minimum Empirical Divergence (PMED) algorithm and derive its asymptotically optimal regret bound. Because of the uncertainty of the position bias; the optimal algorithm for such a problem requires non-convex optimizations that are different from usual partial monitoring and semi-bandit problems. We propose a cutting-plane method and related bi-convex relaxation for these optimizations by using auxiliary variables.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7085-position-based-multiple-play-bandit-problem-with-unknown-position-bias/bibtex,Junpei Komiyama; Junya Honda; Akiko Takeda

Theoretically; our algorithm achieves an $\calO(\log T)$ regret bound. Numerical results show that our algorithm offers a competing performance to that of the nonparametric batch learning algorithm; with a run time comparable to the parametric online learning algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7079-online-learning-for-multivariate-hawkes-processes/bibtex,Yingxiang Yang; Jalal Etesami; Niao He; Negar Kiyavash
2017,DropoutNet: Addressing Cold Start in Recommender Systems,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7081-dropoutnet-addressing-cold-start-in-recommender-systems.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7081-dropoutnet-addressing-cold-start-in-recommender-systems,Latent models have become the default choice for recommender systems due to their performance and scalability. However; research in this area has primarily focused on modeling user-item interactions;  and few latent models have been developed for cold start. Deep learning has recently achieved remarkable success showing excellent results for diverse input types. Inspired by these results we propose a neural network based latent model called DropoutNet to address the cold start problem in recommender systems. Unlike existing approaches that incorporate additional content-based objective terms; we instead focus on the optimization and show that neural network models can be explicitly trained for cold start through dropout. Our model can  be applied on top of any existing latent model effectively providing cold start capabilities; and full power of deep architectures. Empirically we demonstrate  state-of-the-art accuracy on publicly available benchmarks.

2017,Fast; Sample-Efficient Algorithms for Structured Phase Retrieval,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7077-fast-sample-efficient-algorithms-for-structured-phase-retrieval.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7077-fast-sample-efficient-algorithms-for-structured-phase-retrieval,We consider the problem of recovering a signal x in R^n; from magnitude-only measurements; y_i = |a_i^T x|  for i={1;2...m}.  Also known as the phase retrieval problem; it is a fundamental challenge in nano-; bio- and astronomical imaging systems; astronomical imaging; and speech processing. The problem is ill-posed; and therefore additional assumptions on the signal and/or the measurements are necessary.  In this paper; we first study the case where the underlying signal x is s-sparse. We develop a novel recovery algorithm that we call Compressive Phase Retrieval with Alternating Minimization; or CoPRAM. Our algorithm is simple and can be obtained via a natural combination of the classical alternating minimization approach for phase retrieval; with the CoSaMP algorithm for sparse recovery. Despite its simplicity; we prove that our algorithm achieves a sample complexity of O(s^2 log n) with Gaussian samples; which matches the best known existing results. It also demonstrates linear convergence in theory and practice and requires no extra tuning parameters other than the signal sparsity level s.  We then consider the case where the underlying signal x arises from to structured sparsity models. We specifically examine the case of block-sparse signals with uniform block size of b and block sparsity k=s/b. For this problem; we design a recovery algorithm that we call Block CoPRAM that further reduces the sample complexity to O(ks log n). For sufficiently large block lengths of b=Theta(s); this bound equates to O(s log n). To our knowledge; this constitutes the first end-to-end linearly convergent family of algorithms for phase retrieval where the Gaussian sample complexity has a sub-quadratic dependence on the sparsity level of the signal.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7077-fast-sample-efficient-algorithms-for-structured-phase-retrieval/bibtex,Gauri Jagatap; Chinmay Hegde

In this paper we describe how to use Relation Networks (RNs) as a simple plug-and-play module to solve problems that fundamentally hinge on relational reasoning. We tested RN-augmented networks on three tasks: visual question answering using a challenging dataset called CLEVR; on which we achieve state-of-the-art; super-human performance; text-based question answering using the bAbI suite of tasks; and complex reasoning about dynamical physical systems. Then; using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational questions; but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs. Thus; by simply augmenting convolutions; LSTMs; and MLPs with RNs; we can remove computational burden from network components that are not well-suited to handle relational reasoning; reduce overall network complexity; and gain a general ability to reason about the relations between entities and their properties.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7082-a-simple-neural-network-module-for-relational-reasoning/bibtex,Adam Santoro; David Raposo; David G.

The goal is to learn a real-valued prediction function; and the training output labels indicate an interval of possible values. Whereas most existing algorithms for this task are linear models; in this paper we investigate learning nonlinear tree models. We propose to learn a tree by minimizing a margin-based discriminative objective function; and we provide a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the optimal solution in log-linear time. We show empirically that this algorithm achieves state-of-the-art speed and prediction accuracy in a benchmark of several data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7080-maximum-margin-interval-trees/bibtex,Alexandre Drouin; Toby Hocking; Francois Laviolette

We study the game tree search problem; where the goal is to quickly identify the optimal move in a given game tree by sequentially sampling its stochastic payoffs. We develop new algorithms for trees of arbitrary depth; that operate by summarizing all deeper levels of the tree into confidence intervals at depth one; and applying a best arm identification procedure at the root. We prove new sample complexity guarantees with a refined dependence on the problem instance.

A hash embedding may be seen as an interpolation between a standard word embedding and a word embedding created using a random hash function (the hashing trick). In hash embeddings each token is represented by $k$ $d$-dimensional embeddings vectors and one $k$ dimensional weight vector. The final $d$ dimensional representation of the token is the product of the two. Rather than fitting the embedding vectors for each token these are selected by the hashing trick from a shared pool of $B$ embedding vectors.  Our experiments show that hash embeddings can easily deal with huge vocabularies consisting of millions tokens. When using a hash embedding there is no need to create a dictionary before training nor to perform any kind of vocabulary pruning after training. We show that models trained using hash embeddings exhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular embeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore; the number of parameters needed by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular embedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the hashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding; hash embeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing regular embedding types.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7078-hash-embeddings-for-efficient-word-representations/bibtex,Dan Tito Svenstrup; Jonas Hansen; Ole Winther

These techniques can potentially significantly improve DNNs prediction performance by trading-off coverage. In this paper we propose a method to construct a selective classifier given a trained neural network. Our method allows a user to set a desired risk level. At test time; the classifier rejects instances as needed; to grant the desired risk (with high probability). Empirical results over CIFAR and ImageNet convincingly demonstrate the viability of our method; which opens up possibilities to operate DNNs in mission-critical applications. For example; using our method an unprecedented 2% error in top-5 ImageNet classification can be guaranteed with probability 99.9%; with almost 60% test coverage.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7073-selective-classification-for-deep-neural-networks/bibtex,Yonatan Geifman; Ran El-Yaniv

However; its main drawback is that it neglects possible interactions between predictor variables. In this paper; we reexamine the group additive model proposed in the literature; and rigorously define the intrinsic group additive structure for the relationship between the response variable $Y$ and the predictor vector $\vect{X}$; and further develop an effective structure-penalized kernel method for simultaneous identification of the intrinsic group additive structure and nonparametric function estimation. The method utilizes a novel complexity measure we derive for group additive structures. We show that the proposed method is consistent in identifying the intrinsic group additive structure.  Simulation study and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as a general tool for high dimensional nonparametric regression.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7076-group-additive-structure-identification-for-kernel-nonparametric-regression/bibtex,Chao Pan; Michael Zhu

We first derive two equations and obtain two nonlinear operators for geodesically convex optimization instead of the linear extrapolation step in Euclidean space. In particular; we analyze the global convergence properties of our accelerated method for geodesically strongly-convex problems; which show that our method improves the convergence rate from O((1-\mu/L)^{k}) to O((1-\sqrt{\mu/L})^{k}). Moreover; our method also improves the global convergence rate on geodesically general convex problems from O(1/k) to O(1/k^{2}). Finally; we give a specific iterative scheme for matrix Karcher mean problems; and validate our theoretical results with experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7072-accelerated-first-order-methods-for-geodesically-convex-optimization-on-riemannian-manifolds/bibtex,Yuanyuan Liu; Fanhua Shang; James Cheng; Hong Cheng; Licheng Jiao

In this work; we propose a multi-task learning framework for contextual bandit problems. Like multi-task learning in the batch setting; the goal is to leverage similarities in contexts for different arms so as to improve the agent's ability to predict rewards from contexts. We propose an upper confidence bound-based multi-task learning algorithm for contextual bandits; establish a corresponding regret bound; and interpret this bound to quantify the advantages of learning in the presence of high task (arm) similarity. We also describe an effective scheme for estimating task similarity from data; and demonstrate our algorithm's performance on several data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7070-multi-task-learning-for-contextual-bandits/bibtex,Aniket Anand Deshmukh; Urun Dogan; Clay Scott

Firstly; we propose a new rule for greedy selection based on an $\ell_1$-norm square approximation  which is nontrivial to solve but convex; then an efficient algorithm called ``SOft ThreshOlding PrOjection (SOTOPO)'' is proposed to exactly solve the $\ell_1$-regularized $\ell_1$-norm square approximation problem; which is induced by the new rule.  Based on the new rule and the SOTOPO algorithm; the Nesterov's acceleration and stochastic optimization strategies are then successfully applied to the GCD algorithm. The resulted algorithm called accelerated stochastic greedy coordinate descent (ASGCD) has the optimal convergence rate $O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$;  meanwhile; it reduces the iteration complexity of greedy selection up to a factor of sample size. Both theoretically and empirically; we show that ASGCD has better performance for high-dimensional and dense problems with sparse solution.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7069-accelerated-stochastic-greedy-coordinate-descent-by-soft-thresholding-projection-onto-simplex/bibtex,Chaobing Song; Shaobo Cui; Yong Jiang; Shu-Tao Xia

They have been recently extended to model other types of data beyond text; such as items in recommendation systems. Embedding models consider the probability of a target observation (a word or an item) conditioned on the elements in the context (other words or items). In this paper; we show that conditioning on all the elements in the context is not optimal. Instead; we model the probability of the target conditioned on a learned subset of the elements in the context. We use amortized variational inference to automatically choose this subset. Compared to standard embedding models; this method improves predictions and the quality of the embeddings.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7067-context-selection-for-embedding-models/bibtex,Liping Liu; Francisco Ruiz; Susan Athey; David Blei
2017,Minimax Estimation of Bandable Precision Matrices,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7074-minimax-estimation-of-bandable-precision-matrices.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7074-minimax-estimation-of-bandable-precision-matrices,The inverse covariance matrix provides considerable insight for understanding statistical models in the multivariate setting.  In particular; when the distribution over variables is assumed to be multivariate normal; the sparsity pattern in the inverse covariance matrix; commonly referred to as the precision matrix; corresponds to the adjacency matrix representation of the Gauss-Markov graph; which encodes conditional independence statements between variables.  Minimax results under the spectral norm have previously been established for covariance matrices; both sparse and banded; and for sparse precision matrices.  We establish minimax estimation bounds for estimating banded precision matrices under the spectral norm. Our results greatly improve upon the existing bounds; in particular; we find that the minimax rate for estimating banded precision matrices matches that of estimating banded covariance matrices.  The key insight in our analysis is that we are able to obtain barely-noisy estimates of $k \times k$ subblocks of the precision matrix by inverting slightly wider blocks of the empirical covariance matrix along the diagonal.  Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments demonstrating the sharpness of our bounds.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7074-minimax-estimation-of-bandable-precision-matrices/bibtex,Addison Hu; Sahand Negahban
2017,Learning to Prune Deep Neural Networks via Layer-wise Optimal Brain Surgeon,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7071-learning-to-prune-deep-neural-networks-via-layer-wise-optimal-brain-surgeon.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7071-learning-to-prune-deep-neural-networks-via-layer-wise-optimal-brain-surgeon,How to develop slim and accurate deep neural networks has become crucial for real- world applications; especially for those employed in embedded systems. Though previous work along this research line has shown some promising results; most existing methods either fail to significantly compress a well-trained deep network or require a heavy retraining process for the pruned deep network to re-boost its prediction performance. In this paper; we propose a new layer-wise pruning method for deep neural networks. In our proposed method; parameters of each individual layer are pruned independently based on second order derivatives of a layer-wise error function with respect to the corresponding parameters. We prove that the final prediction performance drop after pruning is bounded by a linear combination of the reconstructed errors caused at each layer. By controlling layer-wise errors properly; one only needs to perform a light retraining process on the pruned network to resume its original prediction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our pruning method compared with several state-of-the-art baseline methods.

We show that the proposed loss; that maximizes the distance between the closest positive and closest negative example in the batch; is better than complex regularization methods; it works well for both shallow and deep convolution network architectures. Applying the novel loss to the L2Net CNN architecture results in a compact descriptor named HardNet. It has the same dimensionality as SIFT (128) and shows state-of-art performance in wide baseline stereo; patch verification and instance retrieval benchmarks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7068-working-hard-to-know-your-neighbors-margins-local-descriptor-learning-loss/bibtex,Anastasiia Mishchuk; Dmytro Mishkin; Filip Radenovic; Jiri Matas
2017,Scalable Variational Inference for Dynamical Systems,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7066-scalable-variational-inference-for-dynamical-systems.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7066-scalable-variational-inference-for-dynamical-systems,Gradient matching is a promising tool for learning parameters and state dynamics of ordinary differential equations. It is a grid free inference approach; which; for fully observable systems is at times competitive with numerical integration. However; for many real-world applications; only sparse observations are available or even unobserved variables are included in the model description. In these cases most gradient matching methods are difficult to apply or simply do not provide satisfactory results. That is why; despite the high computational cost;  numerical integration is still the gold standard in many applications. Using an existing gradient matching approach; we propose a scalable variational inference framework which can infer states and parameters simultaneously; offers computational speedups; improved accuracy and works well even under model misspecifications in a partially observable system.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7066-scalable-variational-inference-for-dynamical-systems/bibtex,Nico S.

2017,Resurrecting the sigmoid in deep learning through dynamical isometry: theory and practice,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7064-resurrecting-the-sigmoid-in-deep-learning-through-dynamical-isometry-theory-and-practice.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7064-resurrecting-the-sigmoid-in-deep-learning-through-dynamical-isometry-theory-and-practice,It is well known that weight initialization in deep networks can have a dramatic impact on learning speed. For example; ensuring the mean squared singular value of a network's input-output Jacobian is O(1) is essential for avoiding exponentially vanishing or exploding gradients. Moreover; in deep linear networks; ensuring that all singular values of the Jacobian are concentrated near 1 can yield a dramatic additional speed-up in learning; this is a property known as dynamical isometry. However; it is unclear how to achieve dynamical isometry in nonlinear deep networks.  We address this question by employing powerful tools from free probability theory to analytically compute the {\it entire} singular value distribution of a deep network's input-output Jacobian. We explore the dependence of the singular value distribution on the depth of the network; the weight initialization; and the choice of nonlinearity. Intriguingly; we find that ReLU networks are incapable of dynamical isometry. On the other hand; sigmoidal networks can achieve isometry; but only with orthogonal weight initialization. Moreover; we demonstrate empirically that deep nonlinear networks achieving dynamical isometry learn orders of magnitude faster than networks that do not. Indeed; we show that properly-initialized deep sigmoidal networks consistently outperform deep ReLU networks. Overall; our analysis reveals that controlling the entire distribution of Jacobian singular values is an important design consideration in deep learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7064-resurrecting-the-sigmoid-in-deep-learning-through-dynamical-isometry-theory-and-practice/bibtex,Jeffrey Pennington; Samuel Schoenholz; Surya Ganguli
2017,Sample and Computationally Efficient Learning Algorithms under S-Concave Distributions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7065-sample-and-computationally-efficient-learning-algorithms-under-s-concave-distributions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7065-sample-and-computationally-efficient-learning-algorithms-under-s-concave-distributions,We provide new results for noise-tolerant and sample-efficient learning algorithms under $s$-concave distributions. The new class of $s$-concave distributions is a broad and natural generalization of log-concavity; and includes many important additional distributions; e.g.; the Pareto distribution and $t$ distribution. This class has been studied in the context of efficient sampling; integration; and optimization; but much remains unknown about the geometry of this class of distributions and their applications in the context of learning. The challenge is that unlike the commonly used distributions in learning (uniform or more generally log-concave distributions); this broader class is not closed under the marginalization operator and many such distributions are fat-tailed. In this work; we introduce new convex geometry tools to study the properties of $s$-concave distributions and use these properties to provide bounds on quantities of interest to learning including the probability of disagreement between two halfspaces; disagreement outside a band; and the disagreement coefficient. We use these results to significantly generalize prior results for margin-based active learning; disagreement-based active learning; and passive learning of intersections of halfspaces. Our analysis of geometric properties of $s$-concave distributions might be of independent interest to optimization more broadly.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7065-sample-and-computationally-efficient-learning-algorithms-under-s-concave-distributions/bibtex,Maria-Florina F.

2017,Beyond Worst-case: A Probabilistic Analysis of Affine Policies in Dynamic Optimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7061-beyond-worst-case-a-probabilistic-analysis-of-affine-policies-in-dynamic-optimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7061-beyond-worst-case-a-probabilistic-analysis-of-affine-policies-in-dynamic-optimization,Affine policies (or control) are widely used as a solution approach in dynamic optimization where computing an optimal adjustable solution is usually intractable. While the worst case performance of affine policies can be significantly bad; the empirical performance is observed to be near-optimal for a large class of problem instances. For instance; in the two-stage dynamic robust optimization problem with linear covering constraints and uncertain right hand side; the worst-case approximation bound for affine policies is $O(\sqrt m)$ that is also tight (see Bertsimas and Goyal (2012)); whereas observed empirical performance is near-optimal. In this paper; we aim to address this stark-contrast between the worst-case and the empirical performance of affine policies. In particular; we  show that affine policies give a good approximation for the two-stage adjustable robust optimization problem with high probability on random instances where the constraint coefficients are generated i.i.d. from a large class of distributions; thereby; providing a theoretical justification of the observed empirical performance. On the other hand; we also present a distribution such that the performance bound for affine policies on instances generated according to that distribution is $\Omega(\sqrt m)$ with high probability; however; the constraint coefficients are not i.i.d.. This demonstrates that the empirical performance of affine policies can depend on the generative model for instances.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7061-beyond-worst-case-a-probabilistic-analysis-of-affine-policies-in-dynamic-optimization/bibtex,Omar El Housni; Vineet Goyal

The regret of Online Lazy Newton is independent of conditioning: the algorithm's performance depends on the best possible preconditioning of the problem in retrospect and on its \emph{intrinsic} dimensionality. As an application; we show how Online Lazy Newton can be used to achieve an optimal regret of order $\sqrt{rT}$ for the low-rank experts problem; improving by a $\sqrt{r}$ factor over the previously best known bound and resolving an open problem posed by Hazan et al (2016).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7060-affine-invariant-online-optimization-and-the-low-rank-experts-problem/bibtex,Tomer Koren; Roi Livni
2017,A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions,Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However; the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret; such as ensemble or deep learning models; creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response; various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models; but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem; we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions; SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures; and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods; notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification; we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions/bibtex,Scott M.

The estimators are obtained by adaptively partitioning the sample space. Under a suitable prior; we analyze the concentration rate of the posterior distribution; and demonstrate that the rate does not directly depend on the dimension of the problem in several special cases. Another advantage of this class of Bayesian density estimators is that it can adapt to the unknown smoothness of the true density function; thus achieving the optimal convergence rate without artificial conditions on the density. We also validate the theoretical results on a variety of simulated data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7059-convergence-rates-of-a-partition-based-bayesian-multivariate-density-estimation-method/bibtex,Linxi Liu; Dangna Li; Wing Hung Wong
2017,Query Complexity of Clustering with Side Information,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7054-query-complexity-of-clustering-with-side-information.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7054-query-complexity-of-clustering-with-side-information,Suppose; we are given a set of $n$ elements to be clustered into $k$ (unknown) clusters; and an oracle/expert labeler that can interactively answer pair-wise queries of the form; ``do two elements $u$ and $v$ belong to the same cluster?''. The goal is to recover the optimum clustering by asking the minimum number of queries. In this paper; we provide a rigorous theoretical study of this basic problem of query complexity of interactive clustering; and give strong information theoretic lower bounds; as well as nearly matching upper bounds. Most clustering problems come with a similarity matrix; which is used by an automated process to cluster similar points together. To improve accuracy of clustering; a fruitful approach in recent years has been to ask a domain expert or crowd to obtain labeled data interactively. Many heuristics have been proposed; and all of these use a similarity function to come up with a querying strategy. Even so; there is a lack systematic theoretical study. Our main contribution in this paper is to show the dramatic power of side information aka similarity matrix on reducing the query complexity of clustering. A similarity matrix represents noisy pair-wise relationships such as one computed by some  function on attributes of the elements. A natural noisy model is where similarity values are drawn independently from some arbitrary probability distribution $f_+$ when the underlying pair of elements belong to the same cluster; and from some $f_-$ otherwise. We show that given such a similarity matrix; the query complexity reduces drastically from $\Theta(nk)$ (no similarity matrix) to $O(\frac{k^2\log{n}}{\cH^2(f_+\|f_-)})$ where $\cH^2$ denotes the squared Hellinger divergence. Moreover; this is also information-theoretic optimal within an $O(\log{n})$ factor. Our algorithms are all efficient; and parameter free; i.e.; they work without any knowledge of $k; f_+$ and $f_-$; and only depend logarithmically with $n$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7054-query-complexity-of-clustering-with-side-information/bibtex,Arya Mazumdar; Barna Saha
2017,SafetyNets: Verifiable Execution of Deep Neural Networks on an Untrusted Cloud,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7053-safetynets-verifiable-execution-of-deep-neural-networks-on-an-untrusted-cloud.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7053-safetynets-verifiable-execution-of-deep-neural-networks-on-an-untrusted-cloud,Inference using deep neural networks is often outsourced to the cloud since it is a computationally demanding task.? However; this raises a fundamental issue of trust. How can a client be sure that the cloud has performed inference correctly? A lazy cloud provider might use a simpler but less accurate model to reduce its own computational load; or worse; maliciously modify the inference results sent to the client. We propose SafetyNets; a framework that enables an untrusted server (the cloud) to provide a client with a short mathematical proof of the correctness of inference tasks that they perform on behalf of the client. Specifically; SafetyNets develops and implements a specialized interactive proof (IP) protocol for verifiable execution of a class of deep neural networks; i.e.; those that can be represented as arithmetic circuits. Our empirical results on three- and four-layer deep neural networks demonstrate the run-time costs of SafetyNets for both the client and server are low. SafetyNets detects any incorrect computations of the neural network by the untrusted server with high probability; while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the MNIST digit recognition (99.4%) and TIMIT speech recognition tasks (75.22%).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7053-safetynets-verifiable-execution-of-deep-neural-networks-on-an-untrusted-cloud/bibtex,Zahra Ghodsi; Tianyu Gu; Siddharth Garg

Beyond the undoubtedly large number of advantages brought by social-media platforms; a point of criticism has been the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles; caused by social homophily and algorithmic personalization.  In this paper we address the problem of balancing the information exposure} in a social network. We assume that two opposing campaigns (or viewpoints) are present in the network; and that network nodes have different preferences towards these campaigns. Our goal is to find two sets of nodes to employ in the respective campaigns; so that the overall information exposure for the two campaigns is balanced. We formally define the problem; characterize its hardness; develop approximation algorithms; and present experimental evaluation results.  Our model is inspired by the literature on influence maximization; but we offer significant novelties. First; balance of information exposure is modeled by a symmetric difference function; which is neither monotone nor submodular; and thus; not amenable to existing approaches. Second; while previous papers consider a setting with selfish agents and provide bounds on best response strategies (i.e.; move of the last player); we consider a setting with a centralized agent and provide bounds for a global objective function.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7052-balancing-information-exposure-in-social-networks/bibtex,Kiran Garimella; Aristides Gionis; Nikos Parotsidis; Nikolaj Tatti

We develop a reduction from robust improper optimization to stochastic optimization: given an oracle that returns $\alpha$-approximate solutions for distributions over objectives; we compute a distribution over solutions that is $\alpha$-approximate in the worst case.  We show that derandomizing this solution is NP-hard in general; but can be done for a broad class of statistical learning tasks.  We apply our results to robust neural network training and submodular optimization.

This captures a wide array of problems; special instances include matrix completion in the context of recommendation systems; graphon estimation; and community detection in (mixed membership) stochastic block models. Inspired by classical collaborative filtering for recommendation systems; we propose a novel iterative; collaborative filtering-style algorithm for matrix estimation in this generic setting. We show that the mean squared error (MSE) of our estimator converges to $0$ at the rate of $O(d^2 (pn)^{-2/5})$ as long as $\omega(d^5 n)$ random entries from a total of $n^2$ entries of $Y$ are observed (uniformly sampled); $\E[Y]$ has rank $d$; and the entries of $Y$ have bounded support. The maximum squared error across all entries converges to $0$ with high probability as long as we observe a little more; $\Omega(d^5 n \ln^5(n))$ entries.

We learn an adaptive low-cost system by training a gating and prediction model that limits utilization of a high-cost model to hard input instances and gates easy-to-handle input instances to a low-cost model. Our method is based on adaptively approximating the high-cost model in regions where low-cost models suffice for making highly accurate predictions. We pose an empirical loss minimization problem with cost constraints to jointly train gating and prediction models. On a number of benchmark datasets our method outperforms state-of-the-art achieving higher accuracy for the same cost.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7058-adaptive-classification-for-prediction-under-a-budget/bibtex,Feng Nan; Venkatesh Saligrama

Here; we propose a method; i.e. incremental moment matching (IMM); to resolve this problem. IMM incrementally matches the moment of the posterior distribution of the neural network which is trained on the first and the second task; respectively. To make the search space of posterior parameter smooth; the IMM procedure is complemented by various transfer learning techniques including weight transfer; L2-norm of the old and the new parameter; and a variant of dropout with the old parameter. We analyze our approach on a variety of datasets including the MNIST; CIFAR-10; Caltech-UCSD-Birds; and Lifelog datasets. The experimental results show that IMM achieves state-of-the-art performance by balancing the information between an old and a new network.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7051-overcoming-catastrophic-forgetting-by-incremental-moment-matching/bibtex,Sang-Woo Lee; Jin-Hwa Kim; Jaehyun Jun; Jung-Woo Ha; Byoung-Tak Zhang

The QMDP-net combines the strengths of model-free learning and model-based planning. It is a recurrent policy network; but it represents a policy for a parameterized set of tasks by connecting a model with a planning algorithm that solves the model; thus embedding the solution structure of planning in a network learning architecture. The QMDP-net is fully differentiable and allows for end-to-end training. We train a QMDP-net on different tasks so that it can generalize to new ones in the parameterized task set and ?transfer? to other similar tasks beyond the set. In preliminary experiments; QMDP-net showed strong performance on several robotic tasks in simulation. Interestingly; while QMDP-net encodes the QMDP algorithm; it sometimes outperforms the QMDP algorithm in the experiments; as a result of end-to-end learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7055-qmdp-net-deep-learning-for-planning-under-partial-observability/bibtex,Peter Karkus; David Hsu; Wee Sun Lee

Furthermore; in many scientific applications; the goal is to be able to understand the underlying features related to the classification; which prohibits the blind application of deep networks. This motivates the development of a new model based on {\em parameterized} convolutional filters guided by previous neuroscience research; the filters learn relevant frequency bands while targeting synchrony; which are frequency-specific power and phase correlations between electrodes. This results in a highly expressive convolutional neural network with only a few hundred parameters; applicable to smaller datasets.  The proposed approach is demonstrated to yield competitive (often state-of-the-art) predictive performance during our empirical tests while yielding interpretable features.  Furthermore; a Gaussian process adapter is developed to combine analysis over distinct electrode layouts; allowing the joint processing of multiple datasets to address overfitting and improve generalizability.

X taking its values in a feature space X and the goal is to order all possible observations x in X by means of a scoring function s : X ? R so that s(X) and Y tend to increase or decrease together with highest probability. This problem generalizes bi/multi-partite ranking to a certain extent and the task of finding optimal scoring functions s(x) can be naturally cast as optimization of a dedicated functional cri- terion; called the IROC curve here; or as maximization of the Kendall ? related to the pair (s(X); Y ). From the theoretical side; we describe the optimal elements of this problem and provide statistical guarantees for empirical Kendall ? maximiza- tion under appropriate conditions for the class of scoring function candidates. We also propose a recursive statistical learning algorithm tailored to empirical IROC curve optimization and producing a piecewise constant scoring function that is fully described by an oriented binary tree. Preliminary numerical experiments highlight the difference in nature between regression and continuous ranking and provide strong empirical evidence of the performance of empirical optimizers of the criteria proposed.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7046-ranking-data-with-continuous-labels-through-oriented-recursive-partitions/bibtex,St?phan Cl?men?on; Mastane Achab
2017,Simple strategies for recovering inner products from coarsely quantized random projections,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7043-simple-strategies-for-recovering-inner-products-from-coarsely-quantized-random-projections.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7043-simple-strategies-for-recovering-inner-products-from-coarsely-quantized-random-projections,Random projections have been increasingly adopted for a diverse set of tasks in machine learning involving dimensionality reduction. One specific line of research on this topic has investigated the use of quantization subsequent to projection with the aim of additional data compression. Motivated by applications in nearest neighbor search and linear learning; we revisit the problem of recovering inner products (respectively cosine similarities) in such setting. We show that even under coarse scalar quantization with 3 to 5 bits per projection; the loss in accuracy tends to range from ``negligible'' to ``moderate''. One implication is that in most scenarios of practical interest; there is no need for a sophisticated recovery approach like maximum likelihood estimation as considered in previous work on the subject. What we propose herein also yields considerable improvements in terms of accuracy over the Hamming distance-based approach in Li et al. (ICML 2014) which is comparable in terms of simplicity,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7043-simple-strategies-for-recovering-inner-products-from-coarsely-quantized-random-projections/bibtex,Ping Li; Martin Slawski

While existing correlation measures are suitable for discovering average correlation; they fail to discover hidden or potential correlations. To bridge this gap; (i) we postulate a set of natural axioms that we expect a measure of potential correlation to satisfy; (ii) we show that the rate of information bottleneck; i.e.; the hypercontractivity coefficient; satisfies all the proposed axioms; (iii) we provide a novel estimator to estimate the hypercontractivity coefficient from samples; and (iv) we provide numerical experiments demonstrating that this proposed estimator discovers potential correlations among various indicators of WHO datasets; is robust in discovering gene interactions from gene expression time series data; and is statistically more powerful than the estimators for other correlation measures in binary hypothesis testing of canonical examples of potential correlations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7044-discovering-potential-correlations-via-hypercontractivity/bibtex,Hyeji Kim; Weihao Gao; Sreeram Kannan; Sewoong Oh; Pramod Viswanath

We derive the corresponding generalized factorized information criterion (gFIC) for the SBN; which is proven to be statistically consistent with the marginal log-likelihood. To capture the dependencies within hidden variables in SBNs; a recognition network is employed to model the variational distribution. The resulting algorithm; which we call FABIA; can simultaneously execute both model selection and inference by maximizing the lower bound of gFIC. On both synthetic and real data; our experiments suggest that FABIA; when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for learning SBNs; $(i)$ produces a more concise model; thus enabling faster testing; $(ii)$ improves predictive performance; $(iii)$ accelerates convergence; and $(iv)$ prevents overfitting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7047-scalable-model-selection-for-belief-networks/bibtex,Zhao Song; Yusuke Muraoka; Ryohei Fujimaki; Lawrence Carin
2017,Near-Optimal Edge Evaluation in Explicit Generalized Binomial Graphs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7049-near-optimal-edge-evaluation-in-explicit-generalized-binomial-graphs.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7049-near-optimal-edge-evaluation-in-explicit-generalized-binomial-graphs,Robotic motion-planning problems; such as a UAV flying fast in a partially-known environment or a robot arm moving around cluttered objects; require finding collision-free paths quickly. Typically; this is solved by constructing a graph; where vertices represent robot configurations and edges represent potentially valid movements of the robot between theses configurations. The main computational bottlenecks are expensive edge evaluations to check for collisions. State of the art planning methods do not reason about the optimal sequence of edges to evaluate in order to find a collision free path quickly. In this paper; we do so by drawing a novel equivalence between motion planning and the Bayesian active learning paradigm of decision region determination (DRD). Unfortunately; a straight application of ex- isting methods requires computation exponential in the number of edges in a graph. We present BISECT; an efficient and near-optimal algorithm to solve the DRD problem when edges are independent Bernoulli random variables. By leveraging this property; we are able to significantly reduce computational complexity from exponential to linear in the number of edges. We show that BISECT outperforms several state of the art algorithms on a spectrum of planning problems for mobile robots; manipulators; and real flight data collected from a full scale helicopter.

We develop a robust submodular algorithm STAR-T. It is based on a novel partitioning structure and an exponentially decreasing thresholding rule. STAR-T makes one pass over the data and retains a short but robust summary. We show that after the removal of any m elements from the obtained summary; a simple greedy algorithm STAR-T-GREEDY that runs on the remaining elements achieves a constant-factor approximation guarantee. In two different data summarization tasks; we demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing greedy and streaming methods; even if they are allowed the benefit of knowing the removed subset in advance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7042-streaming-robust-submodular-maximization-a-partitioned-thresholding-approach/bibtex,Slobodan Mitrovic; Ilija Bogunovic; Ashkan Norouzi-Fard; Jakub M.

Existing approaches to inference in DGP models assume approximate posteriors that force independence between the layers; and do not work well in practice. We present a doubly stochastic variational inference algorithm; which does not force independence between layers. With our method of inference we demonstrate that a DGP model can be used effectively on data ranging in size from hundreds to a billion points. We provide strong empirical evidence that our inference scheme for DGPs works well in practice in both classification and regression.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7045-doubly-stochastic-variational-inference-for-deep-gaussian-processes/bibtex,Hugh Salimbeni; Marc Deisenroth
2017,Reconstruct &amp; Crush Network,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7041-reconstruct-crush-network.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7041-reconstruct-crush-network,This article introduces an energy-based model that is adversarial regarding data: it minimizes the energy for a given data distribution (the positive samples) while maximizing the energy for another given data distribution (the negative or unlabeled samples). The model is especially instantiated with autoencoders where the energy; represented by the reconstruction error; provides a general distance measure for unknown data. The resulting neural network thus learns to reconstruct data from the first distribution while crushing data from the second distribution. This solution can handle different problems such as Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning or covariate shift; especially with imbalanced data. Using autoencoders allows handling a large variety of data; such as images; text or even dialogues. Our experiments show the flexibility of the proposed approach in dealing with different types of data in different settings: images with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (not-in-training setting); text with Amazon reviews (PU learning) and dialogues with Facebook bAbI (next response classification and dialogue completion).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7041-reconstruct-crush-network/bibtex,Erinc Merdivan; Mohammad Reza Loghmani; Matthieu Geist

On the other hand; modern approaches from engineering; robotics; and graphics are often restricted to narrow domains or require information about the underlying state. We introduce the Visual Interaction Network; a general-purpose model for learning the dynamics of a physical system from raw visual observations. Our model consists of a perceptual front-end based on convolutional neural networks and a dynamics predictor based on interaction networks. Through joint training; the perceptual front-end learns to parse a dynamic visual scene into a set of factored latent object representations. The dynamics predictor learns to roll these states forward in time by computing their interactions; producing a predicted physical trajectory of arbitrary length. We found that from just six input video frames the Visual Interaction Network can generate accurate future trajectories of hundreds of time steps on a wide range of physical systems. Our model can also be applied to scenes with invisible objects; inferring their future states from their effects on the visible objects; and can implicitly infer the unknown mass of objects. This work opens new opportunities for model-based decision-making and planning from raw sensory observations in complex physical environments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7040-visual-interaction-networks-learning-a-physics-simulator-from-video/bibtex,Nicholas Watters; Daniel Zoran; Theophane Weber; Peter Battaglia; Razvan Pascanu; Andrea Tacchetti

In robotics; {\em Simultaneous Location and Mapping} (SLAM) algorithms solve this problem through joint sequential probabilistic inference of their own coordinates and those of external spatial landmarks. We generate the first neural solution to the SLAM problem by training recurrent LSTM networks to perform a set of hard 2D navigation tasks that require generalization to completely novel trajectories and environments. Our goal is to make sense of how the diverse phenomenology in the brain's spatial navigation circuits is related to their function. We show that the hidden unit representations exhibit several key properties of hippocampal place cells; including stable tuning curves that remap between environments. Our result is also a proof of concept for end-to-end-learning of a SLAM algorithm using recurrent networks; and a demonstration of why this approach may have some advantages for robotic SLAM.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7039-training-recurrent-networks-to-generate-hypotheses-about-how-the-brain-solves-hard-navigation-problems/bibtex,Ingmar Kanitscheider; Ila Fiete
2017,Distral: Robust multitask reinforcement learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7036-distral-robust-multitask-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7036-distral-robust-multitask-reinforcement-learning,Most deep reinforcement learning algorithms are data inefficient in complex and rich environments; limiting their applicability to many scenarios. One direction for improving data efficiency is multitask learning with shared neural network parameters; where efficiency may be improved through transfer across related tasks. In practice; however;  this is not usually observed; because gradients from different tasks can interfere negatively; making learning unstable and sometimes even less data efficient. Another issue is the different reward schemes between tasks; which can easily lead to one task dominating the learning of a shared model. We propose a new  approach for joint training of multiple tasks; which we refer to as Distral (DIStill & TRAnsfer Learning). Instead of sharing parameters between the different workers; we propose to share a distilled policy that captures common behaviour across tasks. Each worker is trained to solve its own task while constrained to stay close to the shared policy; while the shared policy is trained by distillation to be the centroid of all task policies. Both aspects of the learning process are derived by optimizing a joint objective function. We show that our approach supports efficient transfer on complex 3D environments; outperforming several related methods. Moreover; the proposed learning process is more robust and more stable---attributes that are critical in deep reinforcement learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7036-distral-robust-multitask-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Yee Teh; Victor Bapst; Wojciech M.

With the goal of maximizing his T-period payoff; the bidder determines the optimal allocation of his budget among his bids for $K$ goods at each period. As a bidding strategy; we propose a polynomial-time algorithm; inspired by the dynamic programming approach to the knapsack problem. The proposed algorithm; referred to as dynamic programming on discrete set (DPDS); achieves a regret order of $O(\sqrt{T\log{T}})$. By showing that the regret is lower bounded by $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for any strategy; we conclude that DPDS is order optimal up to a $\sqrt{\log{T}}$ term. We evaluate the performance of DPDS empirically in the context of virtual trading in wholesale electricity markets by using historical data from the New York market. Empirical results show that DPDS consistently outperforms benchmark heuristic methods that are derived from machine learning and online learning approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7037-online-learning-of-optimal-bidding-strategy-in-repeated-multi-commodity-auctions/bibtex,M.

However; due to the unbounded nature of density ratio; the estimation proceudre can be vulnerable to corrupted data points; which often pushes the estimated ratio toward infinity. In this paper; we present a robust estimator which automatically identifies and trims outliers. The proposed estimator has a convex formulation; and the global optimum can be obtained via subgradient descent. We analyze the parameter estimation error of this estimator under high-dimensional settings. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the estimator.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7038-trimmed-density-ratio-estimation/bibtex,Song Liu; Akiko Takeda; Taiji Suzuki; Kenji Fukumizu

Traditional Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and its Nesterov's acceleration scheme can only achieve ergodic O(1/\sqrt{K}) convergence rates; where K is the number of iteration. By introducing Variance Reduction (VR) techniques; the convergence rates improve to ergodic O(1/K). In this paper; we propose a new stochastic ADMM which elaborately integrates Nesterov's extrapolation and VR techniques. With Nesterov?s extrapolation; our algorithm can achieve a non-ergodic O(1/K) convergence rate which is optimal for separable linearly constrained non-smooth convex problems; while the convergence rates of VR based ADMM methods are actually tight O(1/\sqrt{K}) in non-ergodic sense. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work that achieves a truly accelerated; stochastic convergence rate for constrained convex problems. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art stochastic ADMM methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7034-faster-and-non-ergodic-o1k-stochastic-alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers/bibtex,Cong Fang; Feng Cheng; Zhouchen Lin

By setting the truncation points appropriately; we are able to generate various types of nonlinearities within a unified framework; including sigmoid; tanh and ReLU; the most commonly used nonlinearities in neural networks. The framework readily integrates into existing stochastic neural networks (with hidden units characterized as random variables); allowing one for the first time to learn the nonlinearities alongside model weights in these networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance improvements brought about by the proposed framework when integrated with the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM); temporal RBM and the truncated Gaussian graphical model (TGGM).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7035-a-probabilistic-framework-for-nonlinearities-in-stochastic-neural-networks/bibtex,Qinliang Su; xuejun Liao; Lawrence Carin
2017,Dual Path Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7033-dual-path-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7033-dual-path-networks,In this work; we present a simple; highly efficient and modularized Dual Path Network (DPN) for image classification which presents a new topology of connection paths internally. By revealing the equivalence of the state-of-the-art Residual Network (ResNet) and Densely Convolutional Network (DenseNet) within the HORNN framework; we find that ResNet enables feature re-usage while DenseNet enables new features exploration which are both important for learning good representations. To enjoy the benefits from both path topologies; our proposed Dual Path Network shares common features while maintaining the flexibility to explore new features through dual path architectures. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets; ImagNet-1k; Places365 and PASCAL VOC; clearly demonstrate superior performance of the proposed DPN over state-of-the-arts. In particular; on the ImagNet-1k dataset; a shallow DPN surpasses the best ResNeXt-101(64x4d) with 26% smaller model size; 25% less computational cost and 8% lower memory consumption; and a deeper DPN (DPN-131) further pushes the state-of-the-art single model performance with about 2 times faster training speed. Experiments on the Places365 large-scale scene dataset; PASCAL VOC detection dataset; and PASCAL VOC segmentation dataset also demonstrate its consistently better performance than DenseNet; ResNet and the latest ResNeXt model over various applications.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7033-dual-path-networks/bibtex,Yunpeng Chen; Jianan Li; Huaxin Xiao; Xiaojie Jin; Shuicheng Yan; Jiashi Feng

2017,Is Input Sparsity Time Possible for Kernel Low-Rank Approximation?,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7030-is-input-sparsity-time-possible-for-kernel-low-rank-approximation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7030-is-input-sparsity-time-possible-for-kernel-low-rank-approximation,Low-rank approximation is a common tool used to accelerate kernel methods: the $n \times n$ kernel matrix $K$ is approximated via a rank-$k$ matrix $\tilde K$ which can be stored in much less space and processed more quickly. In this work we study the limits of computationally efficient low-rank kernel approximation. We show that for a broad class of kernels; including the popular Gaussian and polynomial kernels; computing a relative error $k$-rank approximation to $K$ is at least as difficult as multiplying the input data matrix $A \in R^{n \times d}$ by an arbitrary matrix $C \in R^{d \times k}$. Barring a breakthrough in fast matrix multiplication; when $k$ is not too large; this requires $\Omega(nnz(A)k)$ time where $nnz(A)$ is the number of non-zeros in $A$. This lower bound matches; in many parameter regimes; recent work on subquadratic time algorithms for low-rank approximation of general kernels [MM16;MW17]; demonstrating that these algorithms are unlikely to be significantly improved; in particular to $O(nnz(A))$ input sparsity runtimes. At the same time there is hope: we show for the first time that $O(nnz(A))$ time approximation is possible for general radial basis function kernels (e.g.; the Gaussian kernel) for the closely related problem of low-rank approximation of the kernelized dataset.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7030-is-input-sparsity-time-possible-for-kernel-low-rank-approximation/bibtex,Cameron Musco; David Woodruff
2017,Variational Walkback: Learning a Transition Operator as a Stochastic Recurrent Net,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7026-variational-walkback-learning-a-transition-operator-as-a-stochastic-recurrent-net.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7026-variational-walkback-learning-a-transition-operator-as-a-stochastic-recurrent-net,We propose a novel method to {\it directly} learn a stochastic transition operator whose repeated application provides generated samples. Traditional undirected graphical models approach this problem indirectly by learning a Markov chain model whose stationary distribution obeys detailed balance with respect to a parameterized energy function. The energy function is then modified so the model and data distributions match; with no guarantee on the number of steps required for the Markov chain to converge. Moreover; the detailed balance condition is highly restrictive: energy based models corresponding to neural networks must have symmetric weights; unlike biological neural circuits. In contrast; we develop a method for directly learning arbitrarily parameterized transition operators capable of expressing non-equilibrium stationary distributions that violate detailed balance; thereby enabling us to learn more biologically plausible asymmetric neural networks and more general non-energy based dynamical systems.   The proposed training objective; which we derive via principled variational methods; encourages the transition operator to "walk back" (prefer to revert its steps) in multi-step trajectories that start at data-points; as quickly as possible back to the original data points. We present a series of experimental results illustrating the soundness of the proposed approach; Variational Walkback (VW); on the MNIST; CIFAR-10; SVHN and CelebA datasets; demonstrating superior samples compared to earlier attempts to learn a transition operator. We also show that although each rapid training trajectory is limited to a finite but variable number of steps; our transition operator continues to generate good samples well past the length of such trajectories; thereby demonstrating the match of its non-equilibrium stationary distribution to the data distribution.

2017,Safe Adaptive Importance Sampling,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7025-safe-adaptive-importance-sampling.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7025-safe-adaptive-importance-sampling,Importance sampling has become an indispensable strategy to speed up optimization algorithms for large-scale applications. Improved adaptive variants -- using importance values defined by the complete gradient information which changes during optimization -- enjoy favorable theoretical properties; but are typically computationally infeasible. In this paper we propose an efficient approximation of gradient-based sampling; which is based on safe bounds on the gradient. The proposed sampling distribution is  (i) provably the \emph{best sampling} with respect to the given bounds;  (ii) always better than uniform sampling and fixed importance sampling and  (iii) can efficiently be computed -- in many applications  at negligible extra cost. The proposed sampling scheme is generic and can easily be integrated into existing algorithms. In particular; we show that coordinate-descent (CD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can enjoy significant a speed-up under the novel scheme. The proven efficiency of the proposed sampling is verified by extensive numerical testing.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7025-safe-adaptive-importance-sampling/bibtex,Sebastian U.

We consider a setting with multiple classification problems where the target classes may be tied together through logical constraints. For example; a set of classes may be mutually exclusive; meaning that a data instance can belong to at most one of them. The proposed method is based on the intuition that: (i) when classifiers agree; they are more likely to be correct; and (ii) when the classifiers make a prediction that violates the constraints; at least one classifier must be making an error. Experiments on four real-world data sets produce accuracy estimates within a few percent of the true accuracy; using solely unlabeled data. Our models also outperform existing state-of-the-art solutions in both estimating accuracies; and combining multiple classifier outputs. The results emphasize the utility of logical constraints in estimating accuracy; thus validating our intuition.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7023-estimating-accuracy-from-unlabeled-data-a-probabilistic-logic-approach/bibtex,Emmanouil Platanios; Hoifung Poon; Tom M.

We propose a computation strategy that leverages ideas from coding theory to design intermediate computations at the worker nodes; in order to optimally deal with straggling workers. The proposed strategy; named as \emph{polynomial codes}; achieves the optimum recovery threshold; defined as the minimum number of workers that the master needs to wait for in order to compute the output. This is the first code that achieves the optimal utilization of redundancy for tolerating stragglers or failures in distributed matrix multiplication. Furthermore; by leveraging the algebraic structure of polynomial codes; we can map the reconstruction problem of the final output to a polynomial interpolation problem; which can be solved efficiently.

2017,Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled Representations from Video,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7028-unsupervised-learning-of-disentangled-representations-from-video.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7028-unsupervised-learning-of-disentangled-representations-from-video,We present a new model DRNET that learns disentangled image representations from video. Our approach leverages the temporal coherence of video and a novel adversarial loss to learn a representation that factorizes each frame into a stationary part and a temporally varying  component. The disentangled representation can be used for a range of tasks. For example; applying a standard LSTM to the time-vary components enables prediction of future frames. We evaluating our approach on a range of synthetic and real videos. For the latter; we demonstrate the ability to coherently generate up to several hundred steps into the future.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7028-unsupervised-learning-of-disentangled-representations-from-video/bibtex,Emily L.

2017,A Decomposition of Forecast Error in Prediction Markets,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7024-a-decomposition-of-forecast-error-in-prediction-markets.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7024-a-decomposition-of-forecast-error-in-prediction-markets,We analyze sources of error in prediction market forecasts in order to bound the difference between a security's price and the ground truth it estimates. We consider cost-function-based prediction markets in which an automated market maker adjusts security prices according to the history of trade. We decompose the forecasting error into three components: sampling error; arising because traders only possess noisy estimates of ground truth; market-maker bias; resulting from the use of a particular market maker (i.e.; cost function) to facilitate trade; and convergence error; arising because; at any point in time; market prices may still be in flux. Our goal is to make explicit the tradeoffs between these error components; influenced by design decisions such as the functional form of the cost function and the amount of liquidity in the market. We consider a specific model in which traders have exponential utility and exponential-family beliefs representing noisy estimates of ground truth. In this setting; sampling error vanishes as the number of traders grows; but there is a tradeoff between the other two components. We provide both upper and lower bounds on market-maker bias and convergence error; and demonstrate via numerical simulations that these bounds are tight. Our results yield new insights into the question of how to set the market's liquidity parameter and into the forecasting benefits of enforcing coherent prices across securities.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7024-a-decomposition-of-forecast-error-in-prediction-markets/bibtex,Miro Dudik; Sebastien Lahaie; Ryan M.

We propose a novel lower bound on the minimax estimation error which applies to any estimation procedure. We further propose Triangular Estimation (TE); an algorithm for estimating the reliability of workers. TE has low complexity; may be implemented in a streaming setting when labels are provided by workers in real time; and does not rely on an iterative procedure. We prove that TE is minimax optimal and matches our lower bound. We conclude by assessing the performance of TE and other state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7022-a-minimax-optimal-algorithm-for-crowdsourcing/bibtex,Thomas Bonald; Richard Combes

The size of the linear models comprising such methods grows with both dMRI data and connectome resolution; and can become very large when applied to modern data. In this paper; we introduce a method to encode dMRI signals and large connectomes; i.e.; those that range from hundreds of thousands to millions of fascicles (bundles of neuronal axons); by using a sparse tensor decomposition. We show that this tensor decomposition accurately approximates the Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) model; one of the recently developed linear models. We provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of the sparse decomposed model; LiFESD; and demonstrate that it can reduce the size of the model significantly. Also; we develop algorithms to implement the optimisation solver using the tensor representation in an efficient way.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7021-unified-representation-of-tractography-and-diffusion-weighted-mri-data-using-sparse-multidimensional-arrays/bibtex,Cesar F.

Lower bounds are learned for marginal log-likelihood fits observed data and latent codes. When learning with the variational bound; one seeks to minimize the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence of joint density functions from (i) and (ii); while simultaneously seeking to maximize the two marginal log-likelihoods. To facilitate learning; a new form of adversarial training is developed. An extensive set of experiments is performed; in which we demonstrate state-of-the-art data reconstruction and generation on several image benchmarks datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7020-adversarial-symmetric-variational-autoencoder/bibtex,Yuchen Pu; Weiyao Wang; Ricardo Henao; Liqun Chen; Zhe Gan; Chunyuan Li; Lawrence Carin

We present a novel algorithm that outperforms the state of the art for this problem by using a Gaussian process covariance kernel better suited to MISO than those used by previous approaches; and an acquisition function based on a one-step optimality analysis supported by efficient parallelization. We also provide a novel technique to guarantee the asymptotic quality of the solution provided by this algorithm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that this algorithm consistently finds designs of higher value at less cost than previous approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7016-multi-information-source-optimization/bibtex,Matthias Poloczek; Jialei Wang; Peter Frazier

Given their computational complexity; recent research has focused on tractable yet practical subclasses of Dec-POMDPs. We address such a subclass called CDec-POMDP where the collective behavior of a population of agents affects the joint-reward and environment dynamics. Our main contribution is an actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning method for optimizing CDec-POMDP policies. Vanilla AC has slow convergence for larger problems. To address this; we show how a particular decomposition of the approximate action-value function over agents leads to effective updates; and also derive a new way to train the critic based on local reward signals. Comparisons on a synthetic benchmark and a real world taxi fleet optimization problem show that our new AC approach provides better quality solutions than previous best approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7019-policy-gradient-with-value-function-approximation-for-collective-multiagent-planning/bibtex,Duc Thien Nguyen; Akshat Kumar; Hoong Chuin Lau

While there is a large body of work on algorithms for various ERM problems; the exact computational complexity of ERM is still not understood. We address this issue for multiple popular ERM problems including kernel SVMs; kernel ridge regression; and training the final layer of a neural network. In particular; we give conditional hardness results for these problems based on complexity-theoretic assumptions such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. Under these assumptions; we show that there are no algorithms that solve the aforementioned ERM problems to high accuracy in sub-quadratic time. We also give similar hardness results for computing the gradient of the empirical loss; which is the main computational burden in many non-convex learning tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7018-on-the-fine-grained-complexity-of-empirical-risk-minimization-kernel-methods-and-neural-networks/bibtex,Arturs Backurs; Piotr Indyk; Ludwig Schmidt

Although there have been efforts for tracking using motion trajectories and flow features; the complex problem of generating unseen frames has not been studied extensively. In this paper; we deal with this problem using convolutional models within a multi-stage Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework. The proposed method uses two stages of GANs to generate a crisp and clear set of future frames. Although GANs have been used in the past for predicting the future; none of the works consider the relation between subsequent frames in the temporal dimension. Our main contribution lies in formulating two objective functions based on the Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and the Pairwise Contrastive Divergence (PCD) for solving this problem. This method; coupled with the traditional L1 loss; has been experimented with three real-world video datasets; viz. Sports-1M; UCF-101 and the KITTI. Performance analysis reveals superior results over the recent state-of-the-art methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7014-temporal-coherency-based-criteria-for-predicting-video-frames-using-deep-multi-stage-generative-adversarial-networks/bibtex,Prateep Bhattacharjee; Sukhendu Das

Our scheme allows to efficiently employ compute accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs for the training of large-scale machine learning models; when the training data exceeds their memory capacity. Also; it provides adaptivity to any system's memory hierarchy in terms of size and processing speed. Our technique is built upon novel theoretical insights regarding primal-dual coordinate methods; and uses duality gap information to dynamically decide which part of the data should be made available for fast processing. To illustrate the power of our approach we demonstrate its performance for training of generalized linear models on a large-scale dataset exceeding the memory size of a modern GPU; showing an order-of-magnitude speedup over existing approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7013-efficient-use-of-limited-memory-accelerators-for-linear-learning-on-heterogeneous-systems/bibtex,Celestine D?nner; Thomas Parnell; Martin Jaggi

In this work; we explore goals defined in terms of (non-expert) human preferences between pairs of trajectory segments. Our approach separates learning the goal from learning the behavior to achieve it. We show that this approach can effectively solve complex RL tasks without access to the reward function; including Atari games and simulated robot locomotion; while providing feedback on about 0.1% of our agent's interactions with the environment. This reduces the cost of human oversight far enough that it can be practically applied to state-of-the-art RL systems. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach; we show that we can successfully train complex novel behaviors with about an hour of human time. These behaviors and environments are considerably more complex than any which have been previously learned from human feedback.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7017-deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/bibtex,Paul F.

2017,Sobolev Training for Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7015-sobolev-training-for-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7015-sobolev-training-for-neural-networks,At the heart of deep learning we aim to use neural networks as function approximators -  training them to produce outputs from inputs in emulation of a ground truth function or data creation process. In many cases we only have access to input-output pairs from the ground truth; however it is becoming more common to have access to derivatives of the target output with respect to the input -- for example when the ground truth function is itself a neural network such as in network compression or distillation.  Generally these target derivatives are not computed; or are ignored. This paper introduces Sobolev Training for neural networks; which is a method for incorporating these target derivatives in addition the to target values while training. By optimising neural networks to not only approximate the function?s outputs but also the function?s derivatives we encode additional information about the target function within the parameters of the neural network. Thereby we can improve the quality of our predictors; as well as the data-efficiency and generalization capabilities of our learned function approximation. We provide theoretical justifications for such an approach as well as examples of empirical evidence on three distinct domains: regression on classical optimisation datasets; distilling policies of an agent playing Atari; and on large-scale applications of synthetic gradients.  In all three domains the use of Sobolev Training; employing target derivatives in addition to target values; results in models with higher accuracy and stronger generalisation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7015-sobolev-training-for-neural-networks/bibtex,Wojciech M.

A key advantage of this approach is that one need not make parametric assumptions about the form of the encoder distribution. Performance is further enhanced by integrating the proposed encoder with importance sampling. Excellent performance is demonstrated across multiple unsupervised and semi-supervised problems; including semi-supervised analysis of the ImageNet data; demonstrating the scalability of the model to large datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7011-vae-learning-via-stein-variational-gradient-descent/bibtex,Yuchen Pu; Zhe Gan; Ricardo Henao; Chunyuan Li; Shaobo Han; Lawrence Carin

The key idea is to train a regressor that predicts the expected error reduction for a candidate sample in a particular learning state. By formulating the query selection procedure as a regression problem we are not restricted to working with existing AL heuristics; instead; we learn strategies based on experience from previous AL outcomes. We show that a strategy can  be learnt either from simple synthetic 2D datasets or  from a subset of domain-specific data.

2017,Non-parametric Structured Output Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7009-non-parametric-structured-output-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7009-non-parametric-structured-output-networks,Deep neural networks (DNNs) and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are the two main tools for statistical modeling. While DNNs provide the ability to model rich and complex relationships between input and output variables; PGMs provide the ability to encode dependencies among the output variables themselves. End-to-end training methods for models with structured graphical dependencies on top of neural predictions have recently emerged as a principled way of combining these two paradigms. While these models have proven to be powerful in discriminative settings with discrete outputs; extensions to structured continuous spaces; as well as performing efficient inference in these spaces; are lacking. We propose non-parametric structured output networks (NSON); a modular approach that cleanly separates a non-parametric; structured posterior representation from a discriminative inference scheme but allows joint end-to-end training of both components. Our experiments evaluate the ability of NSONs to capture structured posterior densities (modeling) and to compute complex statistics of those densities (inference). We compare our model to output spaces of varying expressiveness and popular variational and sampling-based inference algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7009-non-parametric-structured-output-networks/bibtex,Andreas Lehrmann; Leonid Sigal

The simplest form of MARL is independent reinforcement learning (InRL); where each agent treats all of its experience as part of its (non stationary) environment. In this paper; we first observe that policies learned using InRL can overfit to the other agents' policies during training; failing to sufficiently generalize during execution. We introduce a new metric; joint-policy correlation; to quantify this effect. We describe a meta-algorithm for general MARL; based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning; and empirical game theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The meta-algorithm generalizes previous algorithms such as InRL; iterated best response; double oracle; and fictitious play. Then; we propose a scalable implementation which reduces the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally; we demonstrate the generality of the resulting policies in three partially observable settings: gridworld coordination problems; emergent language games; and poker.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7007-a-unified-game-theoretic-approach-to-multiagent-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Marc Lanctot; Vinicius Zambaldi; Audrunas Gruslys; Angeliki Lazaridou; karl Tuyls; Julien Perolat; David Silver; Thore Graepel

In particular; given a sequence of state posteriors and the system dynamics; i) estimate the corresponding sequence of observations; ii) estimate the observation likelihoods; and iii) jointly estimate the observation likelihoods and the observation sequence. We show how to avoid a computationally expensive mixed integer linear program (MILP) by exploiting the algebraic structure of the HMM filter using simple linear algebra operations; and provide conditions for when the quantities can be uniquely reconstructed. We also propose a solution to the more general case where the posteriors are noisily observed.

The loss of the online learner has two components: the first is the usual loss of the selected actions; and the second is an additional loss due to switching between actions.  Our main contribution gives a tight characterization of the expected minimax regret in this setting; in terms of a complexity measure $\mathcal{C}$ of the underlying metric which depends on its covering numbers. In finite metric spaces with $k$ actions; we give an efficient algorithm that achieves regret of the form $\widetilde(\max\set{\mathcal{C}^{1/3}T^{2/3};\sqrt{kT}})$; and show that this is the best possible. Our regret bound generalizes previous known regret bounds for some special cases: (i) the unit-switching cost regret $\widetilde{\Theta}(\max\set{k^{1/3}T^{2/3};\sqrt{kT}})$ where $\mathcal{C}=\Theta(k)$; and (ii) the interval metric with regret $\widetilde{\Theta}(\max\set{T^{2/3};\sqrt{kT}})$ where $\mathcal{C}=\Theta(1)$.  For infinite metrics spaces with Lipschitz loss functions; we derive a tight regret bound of $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{\frac{d+1}{d+2}})$ where $d \ge 1$ is the Minkowski dimension of the space; which is known to be tight even when there are no switching costs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7000-multi-armed-bandits-with-metric-movement-costs/bibtex,Tomer Koren; Roi Livni; Yishay Mansour

We propose a double sampling strategy on top of a multi-class to binary reduction strategy; which transforms the original multi-class problem into a binary classification problem over pairs of examples. The aim of the sampling strategy is to overcome the curse of long-tailed class distributions exhibited in majority  of  large-scale  multi-class classification problems and to reduce the number of pairs of examples in the expanded data.  We show that this strategy does not alter the consistency of the empirical risk minimization principle defined over the double sample reduction. Experiments are carried out on DMOZ and Wikipedia collections with 10;000 to 100;000 classes where we show the efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of training and prediction time; memory consumption; and predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7004-aggressive-sampling-for-multi-class-to-binary-reduction-with-applications-to-text-classification/bibtex,Bikash Joshi; Massih R.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become a cornerstone for this challenging task. However; the quality of sentences during RNN-based decoding (reconstruction) decreases with the length of the text. We propose a sequence-to-sequence; purely convolutional and deconvolutional autoencoding framework that is free of the above issue; while also being computationally efficient. The proposed method is simple; easy to implement and can be leveraged as a building block for many applications. We show empirically that compared to RNNs; our framework is better at reconstructing and correcting long paragraphs. Quantitative evaluation on semi-supervised text classification and summarization tasks demonstrate the potential for better utilization of long unlabeled text data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7005-deconvolutional-paragraph-representation-learning/bibtex,Yizhe Zhang; Dinghan Shen; Guoyin Wang; Zhe Gan; Ricardo Henao; Lawrence Carin

Examples include AdaGrad; RMSProp; and Adam. We show that for simple overparameterized problems; adaptive methods often find drastically different solutions than gradient descent (GD) or stochastic gradient descent (SGD).  We construct an illustrative binary classification problem where the data is linearly separable; GD and SGD achieve zero test error; and AdaGrad; Adam; and RMSProp attain test errors arbitrarily close to half.  We additionally study the empirical generalization capability of adaptive methods on several state-of-the-art deep learning models. We observe that the solutions found by adaptive methods generalize worse (often significantly worse) than SGD; even when these solutions have better training performance.

2017,Random Permutation Online Isotonic Regression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7006-random-permutation-online-isotonic-regression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7006-random-permutation-online-isotonic-regression,We revisit isotonic regression on linear orders; the problem of fitting monotonic functions to best explain the data; in an online setting. It was previously shown that online isotonic regression is unlearnable in a fully adversarial model; which lead to its study in the fixed design model. Here; we instead develop the more practical random permutation model. We show that the regret is bounded above by the excess leave-one-out loss for which we develop efficient algorithms and matching lower bounds. We also analyze the class of simple and popular forward algorithms and recommend where to look for  algorithms for online isotonic regression on partial orders.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7006-random-permutation-online-isotonic-regression/bibtex,Wojciech Kotlowski; Wouter M.

2017,Learning A Structured Optimal Bipartite Graph for Co-Clustering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7001-learning-a-structured-optimal-bipartite-graph-for-co-clustering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7001-learning-a-structured-optimal-bipartite-graph-for-co-clustering,Co-clustering methods have been widely applied to document clustering and gene expression analysis. These methods make use of the duality between features and samples such that the co-occurring structure of sample and feature clusters can be extracted. In graph based co-clustering methods; a bipartite graph is constructed to depict the relation between features and samples. Most existing co-clustering methods conduct clustering on the graph achieved from the original data matrix; which doesn?t have explicit cluster structure; thus they require a post-processing step to obtain the clustering results. In this paper; we propose a novel co-clustering method to learn a bipartite graph with exactly k connected components; where k is the number of clusters. The new bipartite graph learned in our model approximates the original graph but maintains an explicit cluster structure; from which we can immediately get the clustering results without post-processing. Extensive empirical results are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our model.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7001-learning-a-structured-optimal-bipartite-graph-for-co-clustering/bibtex,Feiping Nie; Xiaoqian Wang; Cheng Deng; Heng Huang
2017,Triple Generative Adversarial Nets,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6997-triple-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6997-triple-generative-adversarial-nets,Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have shown promise in image generation and semi-supervised learning (SSL). However; existing GANs in SSL have two problems: (1) the generator and the discriminator (i.e. the classifier) may not be optimal at the same time; and (2) the generator cannot control the semantics of the generated samples. The problems essentially arise from the two-player formulation; where a single discriminator shares incompatible roles of identifying fake samples and predicting labels and it only estimates the data without considering the labels. To address the problems; we present triple generative adversarial net (Triple-GAN); which consists of three players---a generator; a discriminator and a classifier. The generator and the classifier characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels; and the discriminator solely focuses on identifying fake image-label pairs. We design compatible utilities to ensure that the distributions characterized by the classifier and the generator both converge to the data distribution. Our results on various datasets demonstrate that Triple-GAN as a unified model can simultaneously (1) achieve the state-of-the-art classification results among deep generative models; and (2) disentangle the classes and styles of the input and transfer smoothly in the data space via interpolation in the latent space class-conditionally.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6997-triple-generative-adversarial-nets/bibtex,Chongxuan LI; Taufik Xu; Jun Zhu; Bo Zhang
2017,Counterfactual Fairness,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6995-counterfactual-fairness.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6995-counterfactual-fairness,Machine learning can impact people with legal or ethical consequences when it is used to automate decisions in areas such as insurance; lending; hiring; and predictive policing.  In many of these scenarios; previous decisions have been made that are unfairly biased against certain subpopulations; for example those of a particular race; gender; or sexual orientation.  Since this past data may be biased; machine learning predictors must account for this to avoid perpetuating or creating discriminatory practices. In this paper; we develop a framework for modeling fairness using tools from causal inference. Our definition of counterfactual fairness captures the intuition that a decision is fair towards an individual if it  the same in (a) the actual world and (b) a counterfactual world where the individual belonged to a different demographic group. We demonstrate our framework on a real-world problem of fair prediction of success in law school.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6995-counterfactual-fairness/bibtex,Matt J.

For example; why does a deep neural network assign an image to a particular class? We cast interpretability of black-box classifiers as a combinatorial maximization problem and propose an efficient streaming algorithm to solve it subject to cardinality constraints. By extending ideas from Badanidiyuru et al. [2014]; we provide a constant factor approximation guarantee for our algorithm in the case of random stream order and a weakly submodular objective function. This is the first such theoretical guarantee for this general class of functions; and we also show that no such algorithm exists for a worst case stream order. Our algorithm obtains similar explanations of Inception V3 predictions 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art LIME framework of Ribeiro et al.

2017,Mapping distinct timescales of functional interactions among brain networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6999-mapping-distinct-timescales-of-functional-interactions-among-brain-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6999-mapping-distinct-timescales-of-functional-interactions-among-brain-networks,Brain processes occur at various timescales; ranging from milliseconds (neurons) to minutes and hours (behavior). Characterizing functional coupling among brain regions at these diverse timescales is key to understanding how the brain produces behavior. Here; we apply instantaneous and lag-based measures of conditional linear dependence; based on Granger-Geweke causality (GC); to infer network connections at distinct timescales from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Due to the slow sampling rate of fMRI; it is widely held that GC produces spurious and unreliable estimates of functional connectivity when applied to fMRI data. We challenge this claim with simulations and a novel machine learning approach. First; we show; with simulated fMRI data; that instantaneous and lag-based GC identify distinct timescales and complementary patterns of functional connectivity. Next; we analyze fMRI scans from 500 subjects and show that a linear classifier trained on either instantaneous or lag-based GC connectivity reliably distinguishes task versus rest brain states; with ~80-85% cross-validation accuracy. Importantly; instantaneous and lag-based GC exploit markedly different spatial and temporal patterns of connectivity to achieve robust classification. Our approach enables identifying functionally connected networks that operate at distinct timescales in the brain.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6999-mapping-distinct-timescales-of-functional-interactions-among-brain-networks/bibtex,Mali Sundaresan; Arshed Nabeel; Devarajan Sridharan

Prototypical Networks learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class. Compared to recent approaches for few-shot learning; they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data regime; and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning. We further extend Prototypical Networks to zero-shot learning and achieve state-of-the-art results on the CU-Birds dataset.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6996-prototypical-networks-for-few-shot-learning/bibtex,Jake Snell; Kevin Swersky; Richard Zemel

We propose a transfer framework for the scenario where the reward function changes between tasks but the environment's dynamics remain the same. Our approach rests on two key ideas: "successor features"; a value function representation that decouples the dynamics of the environment from the rewards; and "generalized policy improvement"; a generalization of dynamic programming's policy improvement operation that considers a set of policies rather than a single one. Put together; the two ideas lead to an approach that integrates seamlessly within the reinforcement learning framework and allows the free exchange of information across tasks. The proposed method also provides performance guarantees for the transferred policy even before any learning has taken place. We derive two theorems that set our approach in firm theoretical ground and present experiments that show that it successfully promotes transfer in practice; significantly outperforming alternative methods in a sequence of navigation tasks and in the control of a simulated robotic arm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6994-successor-features-for-transfer-in-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Andre Barreto; Will Dabney; Remi Munos; Jonathan J.

Since mutual independence is the target; pairwise similarity measurements are of no use; and thus traditional clustering algorithms are inapplicable.   The distribution of the random variables in $S$ is; in general; unknown; but a sample  is available.  Thus; the problem is cast in terms of time series.  Two forms of sampling are considered: i.i.d.\ and stationary  time series; with the main emphasis being on the latter; more general; case. A consistent; computationally tractable algorithm for each of the settings is proposed; and a number of fascinating open directions for further research are outlined.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6990-independence-clustering-without-a-matrix/bibtex,Daniil Ryabko

The decision maker may choose for a set of actions; where the outcome of an action is corrupted by independent noise.    In this paper we consider a special case where the decision maker has limited knowledge about the distribution of observations for each action; in that only a binary value is observed.  Our objective is to infer the true hypothesis with low error; while minimizing the number of action sampled.  Our main results include the derivation of a lower bound on sample size for our system under limited knowledge and the design of an active learning policy that matches this lower bound and outperforms similar known algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6992-adaptive-active-hypothesis-testing-under-limited-information/bibtex,Fabio Cecchi; Nidhi Hegde

Since intracellular calcium concentration is an indirect measurement of neural activity; computational tools are necessary to infer the true underlying spiking activity from fluorescence measurements. Bayesian model inversion can be used to solve this problem; but typically requires either computationally expensive MCMC sampling; or faster but approximate maximum-a-posteriori optimization.  Here; we introduce a flexible algorithmic framework for fast; efficient and accurate extraction of neural spikes from imaging data. Using the framework of variational autoencoders; we propose to amortize inference by training a deep neural network to perform model inversion efficiently. The recognition network is trained to produce samples from the posterior distribution over spike trains.  Once trained; performing inference amounts to a fast single forward pass through the network; without the need for iterative optimization or sampling. We show that amortization can be applied flexibly to a wide range of nonlinear generative models and significantly improves upon the state of the art in computation time; while achieving competitive accuracy.  Our framework is also able to represent posterior distributions over spike-trains. We demonstrate the generality of our method by proposing the first probabilistic approach for separating backpropagating action potentials from putative synaptic inputs in calcium imaging of dendritic spines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6991-fast-amortized-inference-of-neural-activity-from-calcium-imaging-data-with-variational-autoencoders/bibtex,Artur Speiser; Jinyao Yan; Evan W.

We propose a convex optimization for learning a data transformation with three goals: controlling discrimination; limiting distortion in individual data samples; and preserving utility. We characterize the impact of limited sample size in accomplishing this objective. Two instances of the proposed optimization are applied to datasets; including one on real-world criminal recidivism. Results show that discrimination can be greatly reduced at a small cost in classification accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6988-optimized-pre-processing-for-discrimination-prevention/bibtex,Flavio Calmon; Dennis Wei; Bhanukiran Vinzamuri; Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy; Kush R.

They were shown to achieve optimal convergence rates in a deterministic setting using simple gradient iterates. Here; we study extrapolation methods in a stochastic setting; where the iterates are produced by either a simple or an accelerated stochastic gradient algorithm. We first derive convergence bounds for arbitrary; potentially biased  perturbations; then produce asymptotic bounds using the ratio between the variance of the noise and the accuracy of the current point. Finally; we apply this acceleration technique to stochastic algorithms such as SGD; SAGA; SVRG and Katyusha in different settings; and show significant performance gains.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6987-nonlinear-acceleration-of-stochastic-algorithms/bibtex,Damien Scieur; Francis Bach; Alexandre d'Aspremont
2017,YASS: Yet Another Spike Sorter,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6989-yass-yet-another-spike-sorter.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6989-yass-yet-another-spike-sorter,Spike sorting is a critical first step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data.  This manuscript describes an efficient; reliable pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs); where neural signals appear across many electrodes and spike sorting currently represents a major computational bottleneck. We present several new techniques that make dense MEA spike sorting more robust and scalable. Our pipeline is based on an efficient multi-stage ''triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit'' approach that initially extracts only clean; high-quality waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by temporarily skipping noisy or ''collided'' events (representing two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by developing a neural network detection method followed by efficient outlier triaging. The clean waveforms are then used to infer the set of neural spike waveform templates through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. Our clustering approach adapts a ''coreset'' approach for data reduction and uses efficient inference methods in a Dirichlet process mixture model framework to dramatically improve the scalability and reliability of the entire pipeline. The ''triaged'' waveforms are then finally recovered with matching-pursuit deconvolution techniques. The proposed methods improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and stability on both real and biophysically-realistic simulated MEA data. Furthermore; the proposed pipeline is efficient; learning templates and clustering faster than real-time for a 500-electrode dataset; largely on a single CPU core.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6989-yass-yet-another-spike-sorter/bibtex,Jin Hyung Lee; David E.

However; existing toolkits - both static and dynamic - require that the developer organize the computations into the batches necessary for exploiting high-performance data-parallel algorithms and hardware. This batching task is generally difficult; but it becomes a major hurdle as architectures become complex. In this paper; we present an algorithm; and its implementation in the DyNet toolkit; for automatically batching operations. Developers simply write minibatch computations as aggregations of single instance computations; and the batching algorithm seamlessly executes them; on the fly; in computationally efficient batches. On a variety of tasks; we obtain throughput similar to manual batches; as well as comparable speedups over single-instance learning on architectures that are impractical to batch manually.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6986-on-the-fly-operation-batching-in-dynamic-computation-graphs/bibtex,Graham Neubig; Yoav Goldberg; Chris Dyer

Benefiting from deeper architectures; recent CNNs have demonstrated increasingly strong representation abilities. Despite such improvement; the increased depth and larger parameter space have also led to challenges in properly training a network. In light of such challenges; we propose hyperspherical convolution (SphereConv); a novel learning framework that gives angular representations on hyperspheres. We introduce SphereNet; deep hyperspherical convolution networks that are distinct from conventional inner product based convolutional networks. In particular; SphereNet adopts SphereConv as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by generalized angular softmax loss - a natural loss formulation under SphereConv. We show that SphereNet can effectively encode discriminative representation and alleviate training difficulty; leading to easier optimization; faster convergence and comparable (even better) classification accuracy over convolutional counterparts. We also provide some theoretical insights for the advantages of learning on hyperspheres. In addition; we introduce the learnable SphereConv; i.e.; a natural improvement over prefixed SphereConv; and SphereNorm; i.e.; hyperspherical learning as a normalization method.

Despite its advantage; we face two crucial limitations when we apply the TT decomposition to machine learning problems: the lack of statistical theory and of scalable algorithms. In this paper; we address the limitations. First; we introduce a convex relaxation of the TT decomposition problem and derive its error bound for the tensor completion task. Next; we develop a randomized optimization method; in which the time complexity is as efficient as the space complexity is. In experiments; we numerically confirm the derived bounds and empirically demonstrate the performance of our method with a real higher-order tensor.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6982-on-tensor-train-rank-minimization-statistical-efficiency-and-scalable-algorithm/bibtex,Masaaki Imaizumi; Takanori Maehara; Kohei Hayashi

This paper presents a novel approach for predicting contours which advances the state of the art in two fundamental aspects; i.e. multi-scale feature generation and fusion. Different from previous works directly considering multi-scale feature maps obtained from the inner layers of a primary CNN architecture; we introduce a hierarchical deep model which produces more rich and complementary representations. Furthermore; to refine and robustly fuse the representations learned at different scales; the novel Attention-Gated Conditional Random Fields (AG-CRFs) are proposed.

When used for long-range extrapolation; predictions are particularly sensitive to the choice of kernel parameters. It is therefore critical to account for kernel uncertainty in our predictive distributions. We propose a distribution over kernels formed by modelling a spectral mixture density with a Levy process. The resulting distribution has support for all stationary covariances---including the popular RBF; periodic; and Matern kernels---combined with inductive biases which enable automatic and data efficient learning; long-range extrapolation; and state of the art predictive performance. The proposed model also presents an approach to spectral regularization; as the Levy process introduces a sparsity-inducing prior over mixture components; allowing automatic selection over model order and pruning of extraneous components. We exploit the algebraic structure of the proposed process for O(n) training and O(1) predictions. We perform extrapolations having reasonable uncertainty estimates on several benchmarks; show that the proposed model can recover flexible ground truth covariances and that it is robust to errors in initialization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6983-scalable-levy-process-priors-for-spectral-kernel-learning/bibtex,Phillip A.

2017,Variational Memory Addressing in Generative Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6981-variational-memory-addressing-in-generative-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6981-variational-memory-addressing-in-generative-models,Aiming to augment generative models with external memory; we interpret the output of a memory module with stochastic addressing as a conditional mixture distribution; where a read operation corresponds to sampling a discrete memory address and retrieving the corresponding content from memory. This perspective allows us to apply variational inference to memory addressing; which enables effective training of the memory module by using the target information to guide memory lookups. Stochastic addressing is particularly well-suited for generative models as it naturally encourages multimodality which is a prominent aspect of most high-dimensional datasets. Treating the chosen address as a latent variable also allows us to quantify the amount of information gained with a memory lookup and measure the contribution of the memory module to the generative process. To illustrate the advantages of this approach we incorporate it into a variational autoencoder and apply the resulting model to the task of generative few-shot learning. The intuition behind this architecture is that the memory module can pick a relevant template from memory and the continuous part of the model can concentrate on modeling remaining variations. We demonstrate empirically that our model is able to identify and access the relevant memory contents even with hundreds of unseen Omniglot characters in memory.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6981-variational-memory-addressing-in-generative-models/bibtex,J?rg Bornschein; Andriy Mnih; Daniel Zoran; Danilo Jimenez Rezende

Existing models that build conditional generators either require massive labeled instances as supervision or are unable to accurately control the semantics of generated samples. We propose structured generative adversarial networks (SGANs) for semi-supervised conditional generative modeling. SGAN assumes the data x is generated conditioned on two independent latent variables: y that encodes the designated semantics; and z that contains other factors of variation. To ensure disentangled semantics in y and z; SGAN builds two collaborative games in the hidden space to minimize the reconstruction error of y and z; respectively. Training SGAN also involves solving two adversarial games that have their equilibrium concentrating at the true joint data distributions p(x; z) and p(x; y); avoiding distributing the probability mass diffusely over data space that MLE-based methods may suffer. We assess SGAN by evaluating its trained networks; and its performance on downstream tasks. We show that SGAN delivers a highly controllable generator; and disentangled representations; it also establishes start-of-the-art results across multiple datasets when applied for semi-supervised image classification (1.27%; 5.73%; 17.26% error rates on MNIST; SVHN and CIFAR-10 using 50; 1000 and 4000 labels; respectively). Benefiting from the separate modeling of y and z; SGAN can generate images with high visual quality and strictly following the designated semantic; and can be extended to a wide spectrum of applications; such as style transfer.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6979-structured-generative-adversarial-networks/bibtex,Zhijie Deng; Hao Zhang; Xiaodan Liang; Luona Yang; Shizhen Xu; Jun Zhu; Eric P.

It is much easier for a company to deploy an algorithm that is safe; i.e.; guaranteed to perform at least as well as a baseline. In this paper; we study the issue of safety in contextual linear bandits that have application in many different fields including personalized ad recommendation in online marketing. We formulate a notion of safety for this class of algorithms. We develop a safe contextual linear bandit algorithm; called conservative linear UCB (CLUCB); that simultaneously minimizes its regret and satisfies the safety constraint; i.e.; maintains its performance above a fixed percentage of the performance of a baseline strategy; uniformly over time. We prove an upper-bound on the regret of CLUCB and show that it can be decomposed into two terms: 1) an upper-bound for the regret of the standard linear UCB algorithm that grows with the time horizon and 2) a constant term that accounts for the loss of being conservative in order to satisfy the safety constraint. We empirically show that our algorithm is safe and validate our theoretical analysis.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6980-conservative-contextual-linear-bandits/bibtex,Abbas Kazerouni; Mohammad Ghavamzadeh; Yasin Abbasi; Benjamin Van Roy

They rely on solid functional analytic foundations and enjoy optimal statistical properties. However; at least in their basic form;  they have limited  applicability in large scale scenarios because of stringent computational requirements  in terms of time and especially memory. In this paper; we take a substantial step in scaling up kernel methods; proposing FALKON; a novel algorithm that allows to efficiently process millions of points. FALKON is derived combining several algorithmic principles; namely stochastic subsampling; iterative solvers and preconditioning. Our theoretical analysis shows that  optimal statistical accuracy  is achieved  requiring essentially $O(n)$ memory and $O(n\sqrt{n})$  time.

Our approach relies on an analysis of the concentration of mass and angular geometry of the topic simplex; a convex polytope constructed by taking the convex hull of vertices representing the latent topics. Our algorithms are shown in practice to have accuracy comparable to a Gibbs sampler in terms of topic estimation; which requires the number of topics be given. Moreover; they are one of the fastest among several state of the art parametric techniques. Statistical consistency of our estimator is established under some conditions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6977-conic-scan-and-cover-algorithms-for-nonparametric-topic-modeling/bibtex,Mikhail Yurochkin; Aritra Guha; XuanLong Nguyen
2017,Interpolated Policy Gradient: Merging On-Policy and Off-Policy Gradient Estimation for Deep Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6974-interpolated-policy-gradient-merging-on-policy-and-off-policy-gradient-estimation-for-deep-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6974-interpolated-policy-gradient-merging-on-policy-and-off-policy-gradient-estimation-for-deep-reinforcement-learning,Off-policy model-free deep reinforcement learning methods using previously collected data can improve sample efficiency over on-policy policy gradient techniques. On the other hand; on-policy algorithms are often more stable and easier to use. This paper examines; both theoretically and empirically; approaches to merging on- and off-policy updates for deep reinforcement learning.  Theoretical results show that off-policy updates with a value function estimator can be interpolated with on-policy policy gradient updates whilst still satisfying performance bounds. Our analysis uses control variate methods to produce a family of policy gradient algorithms; with several recently proposed algorithms being special cases of this family. We then provide an empirical comparison of these techniques with the remaining algorithmic details fixed; and show how different mixing of off-policy gradient estimates with on-policy samples contribute to improvements in empirical performance. The final algorithm provides a generalization and unification of existing deep policy gradient techniques; has theoretical guarantees on the bias introduced by off-policy updates; and improves on the state-of-the-art model-free deep RL methods on a number of OpenAI Gym continuous control benchmarks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6974-interpolated-policy-gradient-merging-on-policy-and-off-policy-gradient-estimation-for-deep-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Shixiang Gu; Tim Lillicrap; Richard E.

We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions; via transformation matrices; for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules.  When multiple predictions agree; a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained; multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6975-dynamic-routing-between-capsules/bibtex,Sara Sabour; Nicholas Frosst; Geoffrey E.

2017,Incorporating Side Information by Adaptive Convolution,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6976-incorporating-side-information-by-adaptive-convolution.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6976-incorporating-side-information-by-adaptive-convolution,Computer vision tasks often have side information available that is helpful to solve the task. For example; for crowd counting; the camera perspective (e.g.; camera angle and height) gives a clue about the appearance and scale of people in the scene. While side information has been shown to be useful for counting systems using traditional hand-crafted features; it has not been fully utilized in counting systems based on deep learning. In order to incorporate the available side information; we propose an adaptive convolutional neural network (ACNN); where the convolution filter weights adapt to the current scene context via the side information. In particular; we model the filter weights as a low-dimensional manifold within the high-dimensional space of filter weights. The filter weights are generated using a learned ``filter manifold'' sub-network; whose input is the side information. With the help of side information and adaptive weights; the ACNN can disentangle the variations related to the side information; and extract discriminative features related to the current context (e.g. camera perspective; noise level; blur kernel parameters). We demonstrate the effectiveness of  ACNN incorporating side information on 3 tasks: crowd counting; corrupted digit recognition; and image deblurring. Our experiments show that ACNN improves the performance compared to a plain CNN with a similar number of parameters. Since existing crowd counting datasets do not contain ground-truth side information; we collect a new dataset with the ground-truth camera angle and height as the side information.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6976-incorporating-side-information-by-adaptive-convolution/bibtex,Di Kang; Debarun Dhar; Antoni Chan

The algorithm projects the kernel onto a set of s landmark points sampled by their ridge leverage scores; requiring just O(ns) kernel evaluations and O(ns^2) additional runtime. While leverage score sampling has long been known to give strong theoretical guarantees for Nystrom approximation; by employing a fast recursive sampling scheme; our algorithm is the first to make the approach scalable. Empirically we show that it finds more accurate kernel approximations in less time than popular techniques such as classic Nystrom approximation and the random Fourier features method.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6973-recursive-sampling-for-the-nystrom-method/bibtex,Cameron Musco; Christopher Musco

Expert demonstrations provided by humans; however; often show significant variability due to latent factors that are typically not explicitly modeled. In this paper; we propose a new algorithm that can infer the latent structure of expert demonstrations in an unsupervised way. Our method; built on top of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning; can not only imitate complex behaviors; but also learn interpretable and meaningful representations of complex behavioral data; including visual demonstrations. In the driving domain; we show that a model learned from human demonstrations is able to both accurately reproduce a variety of behaviors and accurately anticipate human actions using raw visual inputs. Compared with various baselines; our method can better capture the latent structure underlying expert demonstrations; often recovering semantically meaningful factors of variation in the data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6971-infogail-interpretable-imitation-learning-from-visual-demonstrations/bibtex,Yunzhu Li; Jiaming Song; Stefano Ermon

These neural networks are recursively constructed by following the backward chaining algorithm as used in Prolog.  Specifically; we replace symbolic unification with a differentiable computation on vector representations of symbols using a radial basis function kernel; thereby combining symbolic reasoning with learning subsymbolic vector representations.  The resulting neural network can be trained to infer facts from a given incomplete knowledge base using gradient descent.  By doing so; it learns to (i) place representations of similar symbols in close proximity in a vector space; (ii) make use of such similarities to prove facts; (iii) induce logical rules; and (iv) it can use provided and induced logical rules for complex multi-hop reasoning.  On four benchmark knowledge bases we demonstrate that this architecture outperforms ComplEx; a state-of-the-art neural link prediction model; while at the same time inducing interpretable function-free first-order logic rules.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6969-end-to-end-differentiable-proving/bibtex,Tim Rockt?schel; Sebastian Riedel

This paper proposes a model of attentional scanpath that is based on the principle that there are foundational laws that drive the emergence of visual attention. We devise variational laws of the eye-movement that rely on a generalized view of the Least Action Principle in physics. The potential energy  captures details  as well as peripheral visual features; while the kinetic energy corresponds with the classic interpretation in analytic mechanics. In addition; the Lagrangian contains a brightness invariance term; which characterizes significantly the scanpath trajectories. We obtain differential equations of visual attention as the stationary point of the generalized action; and we propose an algorithm to estimate the model parameters.  Finally; we report experimental results to validate the model in tasks of saliency detection.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6972-variational-laws-of-visual-attention-for-dynamic-scenes/bibtex,Dario Zanca; Marco Gori

The problem has been extensively studied but most works focus on the submodular influence diffusion models. In this paper; motivated by empirical evidences; we explore influence maximization in the non-submodular regime. In particular; we study the general threshold model in which a fraction of nodes have non-submodular threshold functions; but their threshold functions are closely upper- and lower-bounded by some submodular functions (we call them $\varepsilon$-almost submodular). We first show a strong hardness result: there is no $1/n^{\gamma/c}$ approximation for influence maximization (unless P = NP) for all networks with up to $n^{\gamma}$ $\varepsilon$-almost submodular nodes; where $\gamma$ is in (0;1) and $c$ is a parameter depending on $\varepsilon$. This indicates that influence maximization is still hard to approximate even though threshold functions are close to submodular. We then provide $(1-\varepsilon)^{\ell}(1-1/e)$ approximation algorithms when the number of $\varepsilon$-almost submodular nodes is $\ell$. Finally; we conduct experiments on a number of real-world datasets; and the results demonstrate that our approximation algorithms outperform other baseline algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6970-influence-maximization-with-varepsilon-almost-submodular-threshold-functions/bibtex,Qiang Li; Wei Chen; Institute of Computing Xiaoming Sun; Institute of Computing Jialin Zhang
2017,Diving into the shallows: a computational perspective on large-scale shallow learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6968-diving-into-the-shallows-a-computational-perspective-on-large-scale-shallow-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6968-diving-into-the-shallows-a-computational-perspective-on-large-scale-shallow-learning,Remarkable recent success of deep neural networks has not been easy to analyze theoretically. It has been  particularly hard to disentangle relative significance of architecture and optimization in achieving accurate classification on large datasets. On the flip side; shallow methods (such as kernel methods) have  encountered obstacles in scaling to large data; despite excellent performance on smaller datasets; and extensive theoretical analysis. Practical methods; such as variants of gradient descent used so successfully in deep learning; seem to perform below par when applied to kernel methods. This difficulty has sometimes been attributed to the limitations of shallow  architecture.   In this paper we  identify a basic limitation in gradient descent-based optimization methods when used in conjunctions with smooth kernels. Our analysis demonstrates that only a vanishingly small fraction of the function space is reachable after a polynomial number of gradient descent iterations. That drastically limits the approximating power of gradient descent leading to over-regularization. The issue is purely algorithmic; persisting even in the limit of infinite data.  To address this shortcoming in practice; we introduce EigenPro iteration; a simple and direct preconditioning scheme using a small number of approximately computed eigenvectors. It can also be viewed as learning a kernel optimized for gradient descent. Injecting this small; computationally inexpensive and SGD-compatible; amount of approximate second-order information leads to major improvements in convergence. For large data; this leads to a  significant performance  boost over the state-of-the-art kernel methods. In particular; we are able to match or improve the results reported in the literature at a small fraction of their computational budget.

The notion of the price of anarchy takes a worst-case stance to efficiency analysis; considering instance independent guarantees of efficiency. We propose a data-dependent analog of the price of anarchy that refines this worst-case assuming access to samples of strategic behavior. We focus on auction settings; where the latter is non-trivial due to the private information held by participants. Our approach to bounding the efficiency from data is robust to statistical errors and mis-specification. Unlike traditional econometrics; which seek to learn the private information of players from observed behavior and then analyze properties of the outcome; we directly quantify the inefficiency without going through the private information. We apply our approach to datasets from a sponsored search auction system and find empirical results that are a significant improvement over bounds from worst-case analysis.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6967-welfare-guarantees-from-data/bibtex,Darrell Hoy; Denis Nekipelov; Vasilis Syrgkanis

First; we amend the original Mondrian Forest algorithm proposed in~\cite{lakshminarayanan2014mondrianforests}; that considers a \emph{fixed} lifetime parameter.  Indeed; the fact that this parameter is fixed actually hinders statistical consistency of the original procedure.  Our modified Mondrian Forest algorithm grows trees with increasing lifetime parameters $\lambda_n$; and uses an alternative updating rule; allowing to work also in an online fashion.   Second; we provide a theoretical analysis establishing simple conditions for consistency. Our theoretical analysis also exhibits a surprising fact: our algorithm achieves the minimax rate (optimal rate) for the estimation of a Lipschitz regression function; which is a strong extension of previous results~\cite{arlot2014purf_bias} to an \emph{arbitrary dimension}.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6966-universal-consistency-and-minimax-rates-for-online-mondrian-forests/bibtex,Jaouad Mourtada; St?phane Ga?ffas; Erwan Scornet

Most approximations focus on the high eigenvalue part of the spectrum of the kernel matrix; $K$; which leads to bad performance when the length scale of the kernel is small. In this paper we introduce Multiresolution Kernel Approximation (MKA); the first true broad bandwidth kernel approximation algorithm.  Important points about MKA are that it is memory efficient; and it is a direct method;  which means that it also makes it easy to approximate $K^{-1}$ and $\mathop{\textrm{det}}(K)$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6964-multiresolution-kernel-approximation-for-gaussian-process-regression/bibtex,Yi Ding; Risi Kondor; Jonathan Eskreis-Winkler

Inference for these models typically proceeds via Markov chain Monte Carlo; and can suffer from various computational challenges. In this work; we propose a novel collapsed variational inference algorithm to address this issue. Our work leverages ideas from discrete-time Markov chains; and exploits a connection between these two through an idea called uniformization. Our algorithm proceeds by marginalizing out the parameters of the Markov jump process; and then approximating the distribution over the trajectory with a factored distribution over segments of a piecewise-constant function. Unlike MCMC schemes that marginalize out transition times of a piecewise-constant process; our scheme optimizes the discretization of time; resulting in significant computational savings. We apply our ideas to synthetic data as well as a dataset of check-in recordings; where we demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art MCMC methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6965-collapsed-variational-bayes-for-markov-jump-processes/bibtex,Boqian Zhang; Jiangwei Pan; Vinayak A.

2017,Visual Reference Resolution using Attention Memory for Visual Dialog,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6962-visual-reference-resolution-using-attention-memory-for-visual-dialog.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6962-visual-reference-resolution-using-attention-memory-for-visual-dialog,Visual dialog is a task of answering a series of inter-dependent questions given an input image; and often requires to resolve visual references among the questions. This problem is different from visual question answering (VQA); which relies on spatial attention ({\em a.k.a. visual grounding}) estimated from an image and question pair. We propose a novel attention mechanism that exploits visual attentions in the past to resolve the current reference in the visual dialog scenario. The proposed model is equipped with an associative attention memory storing a sequence of previous (attention; key) pairs. From this memory; the model retrieves previous attention; taking into account recency; that is most relevant for the current question; in order to resolve potentially ambiguous reference(s). The model then merges the retrieved attention with the tentative one to obtain the final attention for the current question; specifically; we use dynamic parameter prediction to combine the two attentions conditioned on the question. Through extensive experiments on a new synthetic visual dialog dataset; we show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (by ~16 % points) in the situation where the visual reference resolution plays an important role. Moreover; the proposed model presents superior performance (~2 % points improvement) in the Visual Dialog dataset; despite having significantly fewer parameters than the baselines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6962-visual-reference-resolution-using-attention-memory-for-visual-dialog/bibtex,Paul Hongsuck Seo; Andreas Lehrmann; Bohyung Han; Leonid Sigal

Our work makes the following assumption: there exists a  non-linear transformation between the joint feature/label space distributions of the two domain $\ps$ and $\pt$. We propose a solution of this problem with optimal transport; that allows to recover an estimated target $\pt^f=(X;f(X))$ by optimizing simultaneously the optimal coupling and $f$. We show that our method corresponds to the minimization of a bound on the target error; and provide an efficient algorithmic solution; for which convergence is proved. The versatility of our approach; both in terms of class of hypothesis or loss functions is demonstrated with real world classification and regression problems; for which we reach or surpass state-of-the-art results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6963-joint-distribution-optimal-transportation-for-domain-adaptation/bibtex,Nicolas Courty; R?mi Flamary; Amaury Habrard; Alain Rakotomamonjy
2017,Geometric Matrix Completion with Recurrent Multi-Graph Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6960-geometric-matrix-completion-with-recurrent-multi-graph-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6960-geometric-matrix-completion-with-recurrent-multi-graph-neural-networks,Matrix completion models are among the most common formulations of recommender systems. Recent works have showed a boost of performance of these techniques when introducing the pairwise relationships between users/items in the form of graphs; and imposing smoothness priors on these graphs. However; such techniques do not fully exploit the local stationary structures on user/item graphs; and the number of parameters to learn is linear w.r.t. the number of users and items. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations by using geometric deep learning on graphs. Our matrix completion architecture combines a novel multi-graph convolutional neural network that can learn meaningful statistical graph-structured patterns from users and items; and a recurrent neural network that applies a learnable diffusion on the score matrix. Our neural network system is computationally attractive as it requires a constant number of parameters independent of the matrix size. We apply our method on several standard datasets; showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art matrix completion techniques.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6960-geometric-matrix-completion-with-recurrent-multi-graph-neural-networks/bibtex,Federico Monti; Michael Bronstein; Xavier Bresson

Reparameterization gradients; or gradient estimates computed via the ``reparameterization trick;'' represent a class of noisy gradients often used in Monte Carlo variational inference (MCVI). However; when these gradient estimators are too noisy; the optimization procedure can be slow or fail to converge. One way to reduce noise is to generate more samples for the gradient estimate; but this can be computationally expensive. Instead; we view the noisy gradient as a random variable; and form an inexpensive approximation of the generating procedure for the gradient sample. This approximation has high correlation with the noisy gradient by construction; making it a useful control variate for variance reduction. We demonstrate our approach on a non-conjugate hierarchical model and a Bayesian neural net where our method attained orders of magnitude (20-2{;}000$\times$) reduction in gradient variance resulting in faster and more stable optimization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6961-reducing-reparameterization-gradient-variance/bibtex,Andrew Miller; Nick Foti; Alexander D'Amour; Ryan P.

Although Hebb's original proposal dates back many decades; the detection of assemblies and their role in coding is still an open and current research topic; partly because simultaneous recordings from large populations of neurons became feasible only relatively recently. Most current and easy-to-apply computational techniques focus on the identification of strictly synchronously spiking neurons. In this paper we propose a new algorithm; based on sparse convolutional coding; for detecting recurrent motifs of arbitrary structure up to a given length. Testing of our algorithm on synthetically generated datasets shows that it outperforms established methods and accurately identifies the temporal structure of embedded assemblies; even when these contain overlapping neurons or when strong background noise is present. Moreover; exploratory analysis of experimental datasets from hippocampal slices and cortical neuron cultures have provided promising results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6958-sparse-convolutional-coding-for-neuronal-assembly-detection/bibtex,Sven Peter; Elke Kirschbaum; Martin Both; Lee Campbell; Brandon Harvey; Conor Heins; Daniel Durstewitz; Ferran Diego; Fred A.

However; there are as yet no analytical tools to compute this information that lies at the intersection between sensory coding and behavioral readout. Here we develop a novel measure; termed the information-theoretic intersection information $\III(S;R;C)$; that quantifies how much of the sensory information carried by a neural response $R$ is  used for behavior during perceptual discrimination tasks. Building on the Partial Information Decomposition framework; we define $\III(S;R;C)$ as the part of the mutual information between the stimulus $S$ and the response $R$ that also informs the consequent behavioral choice $C$. We compute $\III(S;R;C)$ in the analysis of two experimental cortical datasets; to show how this measure can be used to compare quantitatively the contributions of spike timing and spike rates to task performance; and to identify brain areas or neural populations that specifically transform sensory information into choice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6959-quantifying-how-much-sensory-information-in-a-neural-code-is-relevant-for-behavior/bibtex,Giuseppe Pica; Eugenio Piasini; Houman Safaai; Caroline Runyan; Christopher Harvey; Mathew Diamond; Christoph Kayser; Tommaso Fellin; Stefano Panzeri

A common trait in many recently investigated cognitive-like tasks is that they  take into account different data modalities;  such as visual and textual input. In this paper we propose a novel and generally applicable form of attention mechanism that learns high-order correlations between various data modalities. We show that high-order correlations effectively direct the appropriate attention to the relevant elements in the different data modalities that are required to solve the joint task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our high-order attention mechanism on the task of visual question answering (VQA); where we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard VQA dataset.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6957-high-order-attention-models-for-visual-question-answering/bibtex,Idan Schwartz; Alexander Schwing; Tamir Hazan

It becomes increasingly important to understand why they can work for these NP-hard problems on typical data. The landscape of many objective functions in learning has been conjectured to have the geometric property that ``all local optima are (approximately) global optima''; and thus they can be solved efficiently by local search algorithms. However; establishing such property can be very difficult.   In this paper; we analyze the optimization landscape of the random over-complete  tensor decomposition problem; which has many applications in unsupervised leaning; especially in learning latent variable models. In practice; it can be efficiently solved by gradient ascent on a non-convex objective. We show that for any small constant $\epsilon > 0$; among the set of points with function values $(1+\epsilon)$-factor larger than the expectation of the function; all the local maxima are approximate global maxima. Previously; the best-known result only characterizes the geometry in small neighborhoods around the true components. Our result implies that even with an initialization that is barely better than the random guess; the gradient ascent algorithm is guaranteed to solve this problem.   Our main technique uses Kac-Rice formula and random matrix theory. To our best knowledge; this is the first time when Kac-Rice formula is successfully applied to counting the number of local minima of a highly-structured random polynomial with dependent coefficients.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6956-on-the-optimization-landscape-of-tensor-decompositions/bibtex,Rong Ge; Tengyu Ma
2017,A multi-agent reinforcement learning model of common-pool resource appropriation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6955-a-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning-model-of-common-pool-resource-appropriation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6955-a-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning-model-of-common-pool-resource-appropriation,Humanity faces numerous problems of common-pool resource appropriation. This class of multi-agent social dilemma includes the problems of ensuring sustainable use of fresh water; common fisheries; grazing pastures; and irrigation systems. Abstract models of common-pool resource appropriation based on non-cooperative game theory predict that self-interested agents will generally fail to find socially positive equilibria---a phenomenon called the tragedy of the commons. However; in reality; human societies are sometimes able to discover and implement stable cooperative solutions. Decades of behavioral game theory research have sought to uncover aspects of human behavior that make this possible. Most of that work was based on laboratory experiments where participants only make a single choice: how much to appropriate. Recognizing the importance of spatial and temporal resource dynamics; a recent trend has been toward experiments in more complex real-time video game-like environments. However; standard methods of non-cooperative game theory can no longer be used to generate predictions for this case. Here we show that deep reinforcement learning can be used instead. To that end; we study the emergent behavior of groups of independently learning agents in a partially observed Markov game modeling common-pool resource  appropriation. Our experiments highlight the importance of trial-and-error learning in common-pool resource appropriation and shed light on the relationship between exclusion; sustainability; and inequality.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6955-a-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning-model-of-common-pool-resource-appropriation/bibtex,Julien P?rolat; Joel Z.

2017,PASS-GLM: polynomial approximate sufficient statistics for scalable Bayesian GLM inference,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6952-pass-glm-polynomial-approximate-sufficient-statistics-for-scalable-bayesian-glm-inference.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6952-pass-glm-polynomial-approximate-sufficient-statistics-for-scalable-bayesian-glm-inference,Generalized linear models (GLMs)---such as logistic regression; Poisson regression; and robust regression---provide interpretable models for diverse data types. Probabilistic approaches; particularly Bayesian ones; allow coherent estimates of uncertainty; incorporation of prior information; and sharing of power across experiments via hierarchical models. In practice; however; the approximate Bayesian methods necessary for inference have either failed to scale to large data sets or failed to provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of inference. We propose a new approach based on constructing polynomial approximate sufficient statistics for GLMs (PASS-GLM). We demonstrate that our method admits a simple algorithm as well as trivial streaming and distributed extensions that do not compound error across computations. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of point (MAP) estimates; the approximate posterior; and posterior mean and uncertainty estimates. We validate our approach empirically in the case of logistic regression using a quadratic approximation and show competitive performance with stochastic gradient descent; MCMC; and the Laplace approximation in terms of  speed and multiple measures of accuracy---including on an advertising data set with 40 million data points and 20;000 covariates.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6952-pass-glm-polynomial-approximate-sufficient-statistics-for-scalable-bayesian-glm-inference/bibtex,Jonathan Huggins; Ryan P.

We introduce the Kalman variational auto-encoder; a framework for unsupervised learning of sequential data that disentangles two latent representations: an object's representation; coming from a recognition model; and a latent state describing its dynamics. As a result; the evolution of the world can be imagined and missing data imputed; both without the need to  generate high dimensional frames at each time step. The model is trained end-to-end on videos of a variety of simulated physical systems; and outperforms competing methods in generative and missing data imputation tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6951-a-disentangled-recognition-and-nonlinear-dynamics-model-for-unsupervised-learning/bibtex,Marco Fraccaro; Simon Kamronn; Ulrich Paquet; Ole Winther
2017,Bayesian GAN,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6953-bayesian-gan.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6953-bayesian-gan,Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can implicitly learn rich distributions over images; audio; and data which are hard to model with an explicit likelihood.  We present a practical Bayesian formulation for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning with GANs.  Within this framework; we use stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to marginalize the weights of the generator and discriminator networks.  The resulting approach is straightforward and obtains good performance without any standard interventions such as feature matching or mini-batch discrimination. By exploring an expressive posterior over the parameters of the generator; the Bayesian GAN avoids mode-collapse; produces interpretable and diverse candidate samples; and provides state-of-the-art quantitative results for semi-supervised learning on benchmarks including SVHN; CelebA; and CIFAR-10; outperforming DCGAN; Wasserstein GANs; and DCGAN ensembles.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6953-bayesian-gan/bibtex,Yunus Saatci; Andrew G.

We build on techniques from combinatorial bandits to introduce a new practical estimator that uses logged data to estimate a policy's performance.  A thorough empirical evaluation on real-world data reveals that our estimator is accurate in a variety of settings; including as a subroutine in a learning-to-rank task; where it achieves competitive performance. We derive conditions under which our estimator is unbiased---these conditions are weaker than prior heuristics for slate evaluation---and experimentally demonstrate a smaller bias than parametric approaches; even when these conditions are violated. Finally; our theory and experiments also show exponential savings in the amount of required data compared with general unbiased estimators.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6954-off-policy-evaluation-for-slate-recommendation/bibtex,Adith Swaminathan; Akshay Krishnamurthy; Alekh Agarwal; Miro Dudik; John Langford; Damien Jose; Imed Zitouni
2017,Concrete Dropout,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6949-concrete-dropout.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6949-concrete-dropout,Dropout is used as a practical tool to obtain uncertainty estimates in large vision models and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. But to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates; a grid-search over the dropout probabilities is necessary?a prohibitive operation with large models; and an impossible one with RL. We propose a new dropout variant which gives improved performance and better calibrated uncertainties. Relying on recent developments in Bayesian deep learning; we use a continuous relaxation of dropout?s discrete masks. Together with a principled optimisation objective; this allows for automatic tuning of the dropout probability in large models; and as a result faster experimentation cycles. In RL this allows the agent to adapt its uncertainty dynamically as more data is observed. We analyse the proposed variant extensively on a range of tasks; and give insights into common practice in the field where larger dropout probabilities are often used in deeper model layers.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6949-concrete-dropout/bibtex,Yarin Gal; Jiri Hron; Alex Kendall
2017,Adaptive Batch Size for Safe Policy Gradients,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6950-adaptive-batch-size-for-safe-policy-gradients.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6950-adaptive-batch-size-for-safe-policy-gradients,Policy gradient methods are among the best Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to solve complex control problems. In real-world RL applications; it is common to have a good initial policy whose performance needs to be improved and it may not be acceptable to try bad policies during the learning process. Although several methods for choosing the step size exist; research paid less attention to determine the batch size; that is the number of samples used to estimate the gradient direction for each update of the policy parameters. In this paper; we propose a set of methods to jointly optimize the step and the batch sizes that guarantee (with high probability) to improve the policy performance after each update. Besides providing theoretical guarantees; we show numerical simulations to analyse the behaviour of our methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6950-adaptive-batch-size-for-safe-policy-gradients/bibtex,Matteo Papini; Matteo Pirotta; Marcello Restelli
2017,Collecting Telemetry Data Privately,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6948-collecting-telemetry-data-privately.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6948-collecting-telemetry-data-privately,The collection and analysis of telemetry data from user's devices is routinely performed by many software companies. Telemetry collection leads to improved user experience but poses significant risks to users' privacy. Locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms have recently emerged as the main tool that allows data collectors to estimate various population statistics; while preserving privacy. The guarantees provided by such algorithms are typically very strong for a single round of telemetry collection; but degrade rapidly when telemetry is collected regularly. In particular; existing LDP algorithms are not suitable for repeated collection of counter data such as daily app usage statistics. In this paper; we develop new LDP mechanisms geared towards repeated collection of counter data; with formal privacy guarantees even after being executed for an arbitrarily long period of time. For two basic analytical tasks; mean estimation and histogram estimation; our LDP mechanisms for repeated data collection provide estimates with comparable or even the same accuracy as existing single-round LDP collection mechanisms. We conduct empirical evaluation on real-world counter datasets to verify our theoretical results. Our mechanisms have been deployed by Microsoft to collect telemetry across millions of devices.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6948-collecting-telemetry-data-privately/bibtex,Bolin Ding; Janardhan Kulkarni; Sergey Yekhanin
2017,Subset Selection under Noise,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6947-subset-selection-under-noise.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6947-subset-selection-under-noise,The problem of selecting the best $k$-element subset from a universe is involved in many applications. While previous studies assumed a noise-free environment or a noisy monotone submodular objective function; this paper considers a more realistic and general situation where the evaluation of a subset is a noisy monotone function (not necessarily submodular); with both multiplicative and additive noises. To understand the impact of the noise; we firstly show the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm and POSS; two powerful algorithms for noise-free subset selection; in the noisy environments. We then propose to incorporate a noise-aware strategy into POSS; resulting in the new PONSS algorithm. We prove that PONSS can achieve a better approximation ratio under some assumption such as i.i.d. noise distribution. The empirical results on influence maximization and sparse regression problems show the superior performance of PONSS.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6947-subset-selection-under-noise/bibtex,Chao Qian; Jing-Cheng Shi; Yang Yu; Ke Tang; Zhi-Hua Zhou
2017,Unsupervised Sequence Classification using Sequential Output Statistics,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6946-unsupervised-sequence-classification-using-sequential-output-statistics.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6946-unsupervised-sequence-classification-using-sequential-output-statistics,We consider learning a sequence classifier without labeled data by using sequential output statistics. The problem is highly valuable since obtaining labels in training data is often costly; while the sequential output statistics (e.g.; language models) could be obtained independently of input data and thus with low or no cost. To address the problem; we propose an unsupervised learning cost function and study its properties. We show that; compared to earlier works; it is less inclined to be stuck in trivial solutions and avoids the need for a strong generative model. Although it is harder to optimize in its functional form; a stochastic primal-dual gradient method is developed to effectively solve the problem. Experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the new unsupervised learning method gives drastically lower errors than other baseline methods. Specifically; it reaches test errors about twice of those obtained by fully supervised learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6946-unsupervised-sequence-classification-using-sequential-output-statistics/bibtex,Yu Liu; Jianshu Chen; Li Deng
2017,Model-based Bayesian inference of neural activity and connectivity from all-optical interrogation of a neural circuit,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6940-model-based-bayesian-inference-of-neural-activity-and-connectivity-from-all-optical-interrogation-of-a-neural-circuit.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6940-model-based-bayesian-inference-of-neural-activity-and-connectivity-from-all-optical-interrogation-of-a-neural-circuit,Population activity measurement by calcium imaging can be combined with cellular resolution optogenetic activity perturbations to enable the mapping of neural connectivity in vivo. This requires accurate inference of perturbed and unperturbed neural activity from calcium imaging measurements; which are noisy and indirect; and can also be contaminated by photostimulation artifacts. We have developed a new fully Bayesian approach to jointly inferring spiking activity and neural connectivity from in vivo all-optical perturbation experiments. In contrast to standard approaches that perform spike inference and analysis in two separate maximum-likelihood phases; our joint model is able to propagate uncertainty in spike inference to the inference of connectivity and vice versa. We use the framework of variational autoencoders to model spiking activity using discrete latent variables; low-dimensional latent common input; and sparse spike-and-slab generalized linear coupling between neurons. Additionally; we model two properties of the optogenetic perturbation: off-target photostimulation and photostimulation transients. Using this model; we were able to fit models on 30 minutes of data in just 10 minutes. We performed an all-optical circuit mapping experiment in primary visual cortex of the awake mouse; and use our approach to predict neural connectivity between excitatory neurons in layer 2/3. Predicted connectivity is sparse and consistent with known correlations with stimulus tuning; spontaneous correlation and distance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6940-model-based-bayesian-inference-of-neural-activity-and-connectivity-from-all-optical-interrogation-of-a-neural-circuit/bibtex,Laurence Aitchison; Lloyd Russell; Adam M.

2017,Certified Defenses for Data Poisoning Attacks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6943-certified-defenses-for-data-poisoning-attacks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6943-certified-defenses-for-data-poisoning-attacks,Machine learning systems trained on user-provided data are susceptible to data poisoning attacks; whereby malicious users inject false training data with the aim of corrupting the learned model. While recent work has proposed a number of attacks and defenses; little is understood about the worst-case loss of a defense in the face of a determined attacker. We address this by constructing approximate upper bounds on the loss across a broad family  of attacks; for defenders that first perform outlier removal followed by empirical risk minimization. Our approximation relies on two assumptions: (1) that the dataset is large enough for  statistical concentration between train and test error to hold; and (2) that outliers  within the clean (non-poisoned) data do not have a strong effect on the model. Our bound comes paired with a candidate attack that often nearly matches the upper bound; giving us a powerful tool for quickly assessing defenses on a given dataset. Empirically; we find that even under a simple defense; the MNIST-1-7 and Dogfish datasets are resilient to attack; while in contrast the IMDB sentiment dataset can be driven from 12% to 23% test error by adding only 3% poisoned data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6943-certified-defenses-for-data-poisoning-attacks/bibtex,Jacob Steinhardt; Pang Wei W.

First; we show that perhaps surprisingly; the finite sum structure; by itself; is not sufficient for obtaining a complexity bound of $\tilde{\cO}((n+L/\mu)\ln(1/\epsilon))$ for $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly convex finite sums - one must also know exactly which individual function is being referred to by the oracle at each iteration. Next; we show that for a broad class of first-order and coordinate-descent finite sums algorithms (including; e.g.; SDCA; SVRG; SAG); it is not possible to get an `accelerated' complexity bound of $\tilde{\cO}((n+\sqrt{n L/\mu})\ln(1/\epsilon))$; unless the strong convexity parameter is given explicitly. Lastly; we show that when this class of algorithms is used for minimizing $L$-smooth and non-strongly convex finite sums; the optimal complexity bound is $\tilde{\cO}(n+L/\epsilon)$; assuming that (on average) the same update rule is used for any iteration; and $\tilde{\cO}(n+\sqrt{nL/\epsilon})$; otherwise.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6945-limitations-on-variance-reduction-and-acceleration-schemes-for-finite-sums-optimization/bibtex,Yossi Arjevani

This problem is motivated by the fact that the number of parameters in $\Theta$ is only $R \cdot \sum_{d=1}^D p_D$; which is significantly smaller than the $\prod_{d=1}^{D} p_d$ number of parameters in ordinary least squares regression. We consider the above CP decomposition model of tensors $\Theta$; as well as the Tucker decomposition. For both models we show how to apply data dimensionality reduction techniques based on {\it sparse} random projections $\Phi \in \RR^{m \times n}$; with $m \ll n$; to reduce the problem to a much smaller problem $\min_{\Theta} \|\Phi \cA(\Theta) - \Phi b\|_2^2$; for which $\|\Phi \cA(\Theta) - \Phi b\|_2^2 = (1 \pm \varepsilon) \| \cA(\Theta) -  b \|_2^2$ holds simultaneously for all $\Theta$. We obtain a significantly smaller dimension and sparsity in the randomized linear mapping $\Phi$ than is possible for ordinary least squares regression.

2017,Neural system identification for large populations separating ?what? and ?where?,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6942-neural-system-identification-for-large-populations-separating-what-and-where.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6942-neural-system-identification-for-large-populations-separating-what-and-where,Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of ?what? and ?where?.  Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among many neurons provides an exciting path forward; but the architectural design needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable recordings from thousands of neurons; experimental time is limited so that one can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space.  Here; we show that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations ? a problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based system identification. Moreover; we show that our network model outperforms current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual cortex.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6942-neural-system-identification-for-large-populations-separating-what-and-where/bibtex,David Klindt; Alexander S.

Specifically; we utilize Fisher information to establish a model-derived prediction of sensitivity to local perturbations of an image. For a given image; we compute the eigenvectors of the Fisher information matrix with largest and smallest eigenvalues; corresponding to the model-predicted most- and least-noticeable image distortions; respectively. For human subjects; we then measure the amount of each distortion that can be reliably detected when added to the image. We use this method to test the ability of a variety of representations to mimic human perceptual sensitivity. We find that the early layers of VGG16; a deep neural network optimized for object recognition; provide a better match to human perception than later layers; and a better match than a 4-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a database of human ratings of distorted image quality. On the other hand; we find that simple models of early visual processing; incorporating one or more stages of local gain control; trained on the same database of distortion ratings; provide substantially better predictions of human sensitivity than either the CNN; or any combination of layers of VGG16.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6944-eigen-distortions-of-hierarchical-representations/bibtex,Alexander Berardino; Valero Laparra; Johannes Ball?; Eero Simoncelli
2017,On Optimal Generalizability in Parametric Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6937-on-optimal-generalizability-in-parametric-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6937-on-optimal-generalizability-in-parametric-learning,We consider the parametric learning problem; where the objective of the learner is determined by a parametric loss function. Employing empirical risk minimization with possibly regularization; the inferred parameter vector will be biased toward the training samples. Such bias is measured by the cross validation procedure in practice where the data set is partitioned into a training set used for training and a validation set; which is not used in training and is left to measure the out-of-sample performance. A classical cross validation strategy is the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) where one sample is left out for validation and training is done on the rest of the samples that are presented to the learner; and this process is repeated on all  of the samples. LOOCV is rarely used in practice due to the high computational complexity. In this paper; we first develop a computationally efficient approximate LOOCV (ALOOCV) and provide theoretical guarantees for its performance. Then we use ALOOCV to provide an optimization algorithm for finding the regularizer in the empirical risk minimization framework. In our numerical experiments; we illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of ALOOCV  as well as our proposed framework for the optimization of the regularizer.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6937-on-optimal-generalizability-in-parametric-learning/bibtex,Ahmad Beirami; Meisam Razaviyayn; Shahin Shahrampour; Vahid Tarokh

In particular; we introduce the notion of a hierarchical route distribution and show how they can be leveraged to construct tractable PSDDs over route distributions; allowing them to scale to larger maps. We illustrate the utility of our model empirically; in a route prediction task; showing how accuracy can be increased significantly compared to Markov models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6939-tractability-in-structured-probability-spaces/bibtex,Arthur Choi; Yujia Shen; Adnan Darwiche

Most such methods employ either linear latent dynamics or linear mappings from latent space to log spike rates. Here we propose a doubly nonlinear latent variable model that can identify low-dimensional structure underlying apparently high-dimensional spike train data. We introduce the Poisson Gaussian-Process Latent Variable Model (P-GPLVM); which consists of Poisson spiking observations and two underlying Gaussian processes?one governing a temporal latent variable and another governing a set of nonlinear tuning curves. The use of nonlinear tuning curves enables discovery of low-dimensional latent structure even when spike responses exhibit high linear dimensionality (e.g.; as found in hippocampal place cell codes). To learn the model from data; we introduce the decoupled Laplace approximation; a fast approximate inference method that allows us to efficiently optimize the latent path while marginalizing over tuning curves. We show that this method outperforms previous Laplace-approximation-based inference methods in both the speed of convergence and accuracy. We apply the model to spike trains recorded from hippocampal place cells and show that it compares favorably to a variety of previous methods for latent structure discovery; including variational auto-encoder (VAE) based methods that parametrize the nonlinear mapping from latent space to spike rates with a deep neural network.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6941-gaussian-process-based-nonlinear-latent-structure-discovery-in-multivariate-spike-train-data/bibtex,Anqi Wu; Nicholas G.

Stemming from the potential outcomes model; we propose a novel multi-task learning framework in which factual and counterfactual outcomes are modeled as the outputs of a function in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vvRKHS). We develop a nonparametric Bayesian method for learning the treatment effects using a multi-task Gaussian process (GP) with a linear coregionalization kernel as a prior over the vvRKHS. The Bayesian approach allows us to compute individualized measures of confidence in our estimates via pointwise credible intervals; which are crucial for realizing the full potential of precision medicine. The impact of selection bias is alleviated via a risk-based empirical Bayes method for adapting the multi-task GP prior; which jointly minimizes the empirical error in factual outcomes and the uncertainty in (unobserved) counterfactual outcomes. We conduct experiments on observational datasets for an interventional social program applied to premature infants; and a left ventricular assist device applied to cardiac patients wait-listed for a heart transplant. In both experiments; we show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6934-bayesian-inference-of-individualized-treatment-effects-using-multi-task-gaussian-processes/bibtex,Ahmed M.

Though rich in modeling; analyzing LDSs is not free of difficulty; mainly because LDSs do not comply with Euclidean geometry and hence conventional learning techniques can not be applied directly. In this paper; we propose an efficient projected gradient descent method to minimize a general form of a loss function and demonstrate how clustering and sparse coding with LDSs can be solved by the proposed method efficiently. To this end; we first derive a novel canonical form for representing the parameters of an LDS; and then show how gradient-descent updates through the projection on the space of LDSs can be achieved dexterously. In contrast to previous studies; our solution avoids any approximation in LDS modeling or during the optimization process. Extensive experiments reveal the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of the convergence and classification accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6936-efficient-optimization-for-linear-dynamical-systems-with-applications-to-clustering-and-sparse-coding/bibtex,Wenbing Huang; Mehrtash Harandi; Tong Zhang; Lijie Fan; Fuchun Sun; Junzhou Huang
2017,Spherical convolutions and their application in molecular modelling,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6935-spherical-convolutions-and-their-application-in-molecular-modelling.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6935-spherical-convolutions-and-their-application-in-molecular-modelling,Convolutional neural networks are increasingly used outside the domain of image analysis; in particular in various areas of the natural sciences concerned with spatial data. Such networks often work out-of-the box; and in some cases entire model architectures from image analysis can be carried over to other problem domains almost unaltered. Unfortunately; this convenience does not trivially extend to data in non-euclidean spaces; such as spherical data. In this paper; we introduce two strategies for conducting convolutions on the sphere; using either a spherical-polar grid or a grid based on the cubed-sphere representation. We investigate the challenges that arise in this setting; and extend our discussion to include scenarios of spherical volumes; with several strategies for parameterizing the radial dimension. As a proof of concept; we conclude with an assessment of the performance of spherical convolutions in the context of molecular modelling; by considering structural environments within proteins. We show that the models are capable of learning non-trivial functions in these molecular environments; and that our spherical convolutions generally outperform standard 3D convolutions in this setting. In particular; despite the lack of any domain specific feature-engineering; we demonstrate performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in the field; which build on decades of domain-specific knowledge.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6935-spherical-convolutions-and-their-application-in-molecular-modelling/bibtex,Wouter Boomsma; Jes Frellsen
2017,Process-constrained batch Bayesian optimisation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6933-process-constrained-batch-bayesian-optimisation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6933-process-constrained-batch-bayesian-optimisation,Abstract Prevailing batch Bayesian optimisation methods allow all control variables to be freely altered at each iteration. Real-world experiments; however; often have physical limitations making it time-consuming to alter all settings for each recommendation in a batch. This gives rise to a unique problem in BO: in a recommended batch; a set of variables that are expensive to experimentally change need to be fixed; while the remaining control variables can be varied. We formulate this as a process-constrained batch Bayesian optimisation problem. We propose two algorithms; pc-BO(basic) and pc-BO(nested). pc-BO(basic) is simpler but lacks convergence guarantee. In contrast pc-BO(nested) is slightly more complex; but admits convergence analysis. We show that the regret of pc-BO(nested) is sublinear. We demonstrate the performance of both pc-BO(basic) and pc-BO(nested) by optimising benchmark test functions; tuning hyper-parameters of the SVM classifier; optimising the heat-treatment process for an Al-Sc alloy to achieve target hardness; and optimising the short polymer fibre production process.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6933-process-constrained-batch-bayesian-optimisation/bibtex,Pratibha Vellanki; Santu Rana; Sunil Gupta; David Rubin; Alessandra Sutti; Thomas Dorin; Murray Height; Paul Sanders; Svetha Venkatesh
2017,ExtremeWeather: A large-scale climate dataset for semi-supervised detection; localization; and understanding of extreme weather events,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6932-extremeweather-a-large-scale-climate-dataset-for-semi-supervised-detection-localization-and-understanding-of-extreme-weather-events.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6932-extremeweather-a-large-scale-climate-dataset-for-semi-supervised-detection-localization-and-understanding-of-extreme-weather-events,Then detection and identification of extreme weather events in large-scale climate simulations is an important problem for risk management; informing governmental policy decisions and advancing our basic understanding of the climate system. Recent work has shown that fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield acceptable accuracy for classifying well-known types of extreme weather events when large amounts of labeled data are available. However; many different types of spatially localized climate patterns are of interest including hurricanes; extra-tropical cyclones; weather fronts; and blocking events among others. Existing labeled data for these patterns can be incomplete in various ways; such as covering only certain years or geographic areas and having false negatives. This type of climate data therefore poses a number of interesting machine learning challenges. We present a multichannel spatiotemporal CNN architecture for semi-supervised bounding box prediction and exploratory data analysis. We demonstrate that our approach is able to leverage temporal information and unlabeled data to improve the localization of extreme weather events. Further; we explore the representations learned by our model in order to better understand this important data. We present a dataset; ExtremeWeather; to encourage machine learning research in this area and to help facilitate further work in understanding and mitigating the effects of climate change. The dataset is available at extremeweatherdataset.github.io and the code is available at https://github.com/eracah/hur-detect.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6932-extremeweather-a-large-scale-climate-dataset-for-semi-supervised-detection-localization-and-understanding-of-extreme-weather-events/bibtex,Evan Racah; Christopher Beckham; Tegan Maharaj; Samira Ebrahimi Kahou; Mr. Prabhat; Chris Pal
2017,Deep Sets,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6931-deep-sets.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6931-deep-sets,We study the problem of designing models for machine learning tasks defined on sets. In contrast to the traditional approach of operating on fixed dimensional vectors; we consider objective functions defined on sets and are invariant to permutations. Such problems are widespread; ranging from the estimation of population statistics; to anomaly detection in piezometer data of embankment dams; to cosmology. Our main theorem characterizes the permutation invariant objective functions and provides a family of functions to which any permutation invariant objective function must belong. This family of functions has a special structure which enables us to design a deep network architecture that can operate on sets and which can be deployed on a variety of scenarios including both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on population statistic estimation; point cloud classification; set expansion; and outlier detection.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6931-deep-sets/bibtex,Manzil Zaheer; Satwik Kottur; Siamak Ravanbakhsh; Barnabas Poczos; Ruslan R.

In many real-world applications; however; several objective functions have to be considered simultaneously. Recently; an algorithm for dealing with several objective functions in the i.i.d. case has been presented.  In this paper; we extend the multi-objective framework to the case of stationary and ergodic processes; thus  allowing dependencies among observations. We first identify an asymptomatic lower bound for any prediction strategy and then present an algorithm whose predictions achieve the optimal solution while  fulfilling  any continuous and convex constraining criterion.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6929-multi-objective-non-parametric-sequential-prediction/bibtex,Guy Uziel; Ran El-Yaniv
2017,A Universal Analysis of Large-Scale Regularized Least Squares Solutions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6930-a-universal-analysis-of-large-scale-regularized-least-squares-solutions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6930-a-universal-analysis-of-large-scale-regularized-least-squares-solutions,A problem that has been of recent interest in statistical inference; machine learning and signal processing is that of understanding the asymptotic behavior of regularized least squares solutions under random measurement matrices (or dictionaries). The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO or least-squares with $\ell_1$ regularization) is perhaps one of the most interesting examples. Precise expressions for the asymptotic performance of LASSO have been obtained for a number of different cases; in particular when the elements of the dictionary matrix are sampled independently from a Gaussian distribution. It has also been empirically observed that the resulting expressions remain valid when the entries of the dictionary matrix are independently sampled from certain non-Gaussian distributions. In this paper; we confirm these observations theoretically when the distribution is sub-Gaussian. We further generalize the previous expressions for a broader family of regularization functions and under milder conditions on the underlying random; possibly non-Gaussian; dictionary matrix. In particular; we establish the universality of the asymptotic statistics (e.g.; the average quadratic risk) of LASSO with non-Gaussian dictionaries.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6930-a-universal-analysis-of-large-scale-regularized-least-squares-solutions/bibtex,Ashkan Panahi; Babak Hassibi

We extend these models to the multi-output setting; i.e.; for learning vector-valued functions; with application to multi-class or multi-task problems. We cast this as the problem of learning a 3-way tensor whose slices share a common basis and propose a convex formulation of that problem. We then develop an efficient conditional gradient algorithm and prove its global convergence; despite the fact that it involves a non-convex basis selection step. On classification tasks; we show that our algorithm achieves excellent accuracy with much sparser models than existing methods. On recommendation system tasks; we show how to combine our algorithm with a reduction from ordinal regression to multi-output classification and show that the resulting algorithm outperforms simple baselines in terms of ranking accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6927-multi-output-polynomial-networks-and-factorization-machines/bibtex,Mathieu Blondel; Vlad Niculae; Takuma Otsuka; Naonori Ueda
2017,Dynamic-Depth Context Tree Weighting,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6925-dynamic-depth-context-tree-weighting.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6925-dynamic-depth-context-tree-weighting,Reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable settings is challenging because the agent?s observations are not Markov. Recently proposed methods can learn variable-order Markov models of the underlying process but have steep memory requirements and are sensitive to aliasing between observation histories due to sensor noise. This paper proposes dynamic-depth context tree weighting (D2-CTW); a model-learning method that addresses these limitations. D2-CTW dynamically expands a suffix tree while ensuring that the size of the model; but not its depth; remains bounded. We show that D2-CTW approximately matches the performance of state-of-the-art alternatives at stochastic time-series prediction while using at least an order of magnitude less memory. We also apply D2-CTW to model-based RL; showing that; on tasks that require memory of past observations; D2-CTW can learn without prior knowledge of a good state representation; or even the length of history upon which such a representation should depend.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6925-dynamic-depth-context-tree-weighting/bibtex,Joao V.

2017,Clustering Billions of Reads for DNA Data Storage,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6928-clustering-billions-of-reads-for-dna-data-storage.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6928-clustering-billions-of-reads-for-dna-data-storage,Storing data in synthetic DNA offers the possibility of improving information density and durability  by several orders of magnitude compared to current storage technologies. However; DNA data storage requires a computationally intensive process to retrieve the data. In particular; a crucial step in the data retrieval pipeline involves clustering billions of strings with respect to edit distance. Datasets in this domain have many notable properties; such as containing a very large number of small clusters that are well-separated in the edit distance metric space. In this regime; existing algorithms are unsuitable because of either their long running time or low accuracy. To address this issue; we present a novel distributed algorithm for approximately computing the underlying clusters. Our algorithm converges efficiently on any dataset that satisfies certain separability properties; such as those coming from DNA data storage systems. We also prove that; under these assumptions; our algorithm is robust to outliers and high levels of noise. We provide empirical justification of the accuracy; scalability; and convergence of our algorithm on real and synthetic data. Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm for clustering DNA sequences; our algorithm simultaneously achieves higher accuracy and a 1000x speedup on three real datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6928-clustering-billions-of-reads-for-dna-data-storage/bibtex,Cyrus Rashtchian; Konstantin Makarychev; Miklos Racz; Siena Ang; Djordje Jevdjic; Sergey Yekhanin; Luis Ceze; Karin Strauss
2017,A Regularized Framework for Sparse and Structured Neural Attention,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6926-a-regularized-framework-for-sparse-and-structured-neural-attention.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6926-a-regularized-framework-for-sparse-and-structured-neural-attention,Modern neural networks are often augmented with an attention mechanism; which tells the network where to focus within the input.  We propose in this paper a new framework for sparse and structured attention; building upon a smoothed max operator. We show that the gradient of this operator defines a mapping from real values to probabilities; suitable as an attention mechanism. Our framework includes softmax and a slight generalization of the recently-proposed sparsemax as special cases. However; we also show how our framework can incorporate modern structured penalties; resulting in more interpretable attention mechanisms; that focus on entire segments or groups of an input.  We derive efficient algorithms to compute the forward and backward passes of our attention mechanisms; enabling their use in a neural network trained with backpropagation.  To showcase their potential as a drop-in replacement for existing ones; we evaluate our attention mechanisms on three large-scale tasks: textual entailment; machine translation; and sentence summarization.  Our attention mechanisms improve interpretability without sacrificing performance; notably; on textual entailment and summarization; we outperform the standard attention mechanisms based on softmax and sparsemax.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6926-a-regularized-framework-for-sparse-and-structured-neural-attention/bibtex,Vlad Niculae; Mathieu Blondel
2017,Adaptive SVRG Methods under Error Bound Conditions with Unknown Growth Parameter,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6920-adaptive-svrg-methods-under-error-bound-conditions-with-unknown-growth-parameter.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6920-adaptive-svrg-methods-under-error-bound-conditions-with-unknown-growth-parameter,Error bound; an inherent property of an optimization problem; has recently revived in the development of algorithms with improved global convergence without strong convexity. The most studied error bound  is the quadratic error bound; which generalizes strong convexity and is satisfied by a large family of machine learning problems. Quadratic error bound have been leveraged to achieve linear convergence in many first-order methods including the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) method; which is one of the most important stochastic optimization methods in machine learning. However; the studies along this direction face the critical issue that the algorithms must depend on an unknown growth parameter (a generalization of strong convexity modulus) in the error bound. This parameter is difficult to estimate exactly and the algorithms choosing this parameter heuristically do not have theoretical convergence guarantee. To address this issue; we propose novel SVRG methods that automatically search for this unknown parameter on the fly of optimization while still obtain almost the same convergence rate as when this parameter is known. We also analyze the convergence property of SVRG methods under H\"{o}lderian error bound; which generalizes the quadratic error bound.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6920-adaptive-svrg-methods-under-error-bound-conditions-with-unknown-growth-parameter/bibtex,Yi Xu; Qihang Lin; Tianbao Yang
2017,VEEGAN: Reducing Mode Collapse in GANs using Implicit Variational Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6923-veegan-reducing-mode-collapse-in-gans-using-implicit-variational-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6923-veegan-reducing-mode-collapse-in-gans-using-implicit-variational-learning,Deep generative models provide powerful tools for distributions over complicated manifolds; such as those of natural images.  But many of these methods; including generative adversarial networks (GANs); can be difficult to train; in part because they are prone to mode collapse; which means that they characterize only a few modes of the true distribution.  To address this; we introduce VEEGAN; which features a reconstructor network; reversing the action of the generator by mapping from data to noise.  Our training objective retains the original asymptotic consistency guarantee of GANs; and can be interpreted as a novel autoencoder loss over the noise.  In sharp contrast to a traditional autoencoder over data points; VEEGAN does not require specifying a loss function over the data; but rather only over the representations; which are standard normal by assumption.  On an extensive set of synthetic and real world image datasets; VEEGAN indeed resists mode collapsing to a far greater extent than other recent GAN variants; and produces more realistic samples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6923-veegan-reducing-mode-collapse-in-gans-using-implicit-variational-learning/bibtex,Akash Srivastava; Lazar Valkoz; Chris Russell; Michael U.

In this work; we argue that the most principled and effective way to attack this problem is by adopting a Bayesian point of view; where through sparsity inducing priors we prune large parts of the network. We introduce two novelties in this paper: 1) we use hierarchical priors to prune nodes instead of individual weights; and 2) we use the posterior uncertainties to determine the optimal fixed point precision to encode the weights. Both factors significantly contribute to achieving the state of the art in terms of compression rates; while still staying competitive with methods designed to optimize for speed or energy efficiency.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6921-bayesian-compression-for-deep-learning/bibtex,Christos Louizos; Karen Ullrich; Max Welling

However; the field lacks a principled method to handle streaming data in which both the posterior distribution over function values and the hyperparameter estimates are updated in an online fashion. The small number of existing approaches either use suboptimal hand-crafted heuristics for hyperparameter learning; or suffer from catastrophic forgetting or slow updating when new data arrive. This paper develops a new principled framework for deploying Gaussian process probabilistic models in the streaming setting; providing  methods for learning hyperparameters and optimising pseudo-input locations. The proposed framework is assessed using synthetic and real-world datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6922-streaming-sparse-gaussian-process-approximations/bibtex,Thang D.

2017,Sparse Embedded k-Means Clustering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6924-sparse-embedded-k-means-clustering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6924-sparse-embedded-k-means-clustering,The $k$-means clustering algorithm is a ubiquitous tool in data mining and machine learning that shows promising performance. However; its high computational cost has hindered its applications in broad domains. Researchers have successfully addressed these obstacles with dimensionality reduction methods. Recently; [1] develop a state-of-the-art random projection (RP) method for faster $k$-means clustering. Their method delivers many improvements over other dimensionality reduction methods. For example; compared to the advanced singular value decomposition based feature extraction approach;  [1] reduce the running time by a factor of $\min \{n;d\}\epsilon^2 log(d)/k$ for data matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d} $ with $n$ data points and $d$ features; while losing only a factor of one in approximation accuracy. Unfortunately; they still require $\mathcal{O}(\frac{ndk}{\epsilon^2log(d)})$ for matrix multiplication and this cost will be prohibitive for large values of $n$ and $d$. To break this bottleneck; we carefully build a sparse embedded $k$-means clustering algorithm which requires $\mathcal{O}(nnz(X))$ ($nnz(X)$ denotes the number of non-zeros in $X$) for fast matrix multiplication. Moreover; our proposed algorithm improves on [1]'s results for approximation accuracy by a factor of one. Our empirical studies corroborate our theoretical findings; and demonstrate that our approach is able to significantly accelerate $k$-means clustering; while achieving satisfactory clustering performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6924-sparse-embedded-k-means-clustering/bibtex,Weiwei Liu; Xiaobo Shen; Ivor Tsang

In its basic form; the algorithm requires computing and sampling from a posterior distribution over models; which is tractable only for simple special cases. This paper develops ensemble sampling; which aims to approximate Thompson sampling while maintaining tractability even in the face of complex models such as neural networks. Ensemble sampling dramatically expands on the range of applications for which Thompson sampling is viable. We establish a theoretical basis that supports the approach and present computational results that offer further insight.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6918-ensemble-sampling/bibtex,Xiuyuan Lu; Benjamin Van Roy

Where the original RHN work primarily provides theoretical treatment of the subject; we demonstrate experimentally that RHNs benefit from far better gradient flow than LSTMs in addition to their improved task accuracy. The original hypernetworks work presents detailed experimental results but leaves several theoretical issues unresolved--we consider these in depth and frame several feasible solutions that we believe will yield further gains in the future. We demonstrate that these approaches are complementary: by combining RHNs and hypernetworks; we make a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art character-level language modeling performance on Penn Treebank while relying on much simpler regularization. Finally; we argue for RHNs as a drop-in replacement for LSTMs (analogous to LSTMs for vanilla RNNs) and for hypernetworks as a de-facto augmentation (analogous to attention) for recurrent architectures.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6919-language-modeling-with-recurrent-highway-hypernetworks/bibtex,Joseph Suarez

Currently; they are often characterized via intensity function which limits model's expressiveness due to unrealistic assumptions on its parametric form used in practice. Furthermore; they are learned via maximum likelihood approach which is prone to failure in multi-modal distributions of sequences. In this paper; we propose an intensity-free approach for point processes modeling that transforms nuisance processes to a target one. Furthermore; we train the model using a likelihood-free leveraging Wasserstein distance between point processes. Experiments on various synthetic and real-world data substantiate the superiority of the proposed point process model over conventional ones.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6917-wasserstein-learning-of-deep-generative-point-process-models/bibtex,SHUAI XIAO; Mehrdad Farajtabar; Xiaojing Ye; Junchi Yan; Le Song; Hongyuan Zha

While it is often easy for domain experts to specify individual transformations; constructing and tuning the more sophisticated compositions typically needed to achieve state-of-the-art results is a time-consuming manual task in practice. We propose a method for automating this process by learning a generative sequence model over user-specified transformation functions using a generative adversarial approach. Our method can make use of arbitrary; non-deterministic transformation functions; is robust to misspecified user input; and is trained on unlabeled data. The learned transformation model can then be used to perform data augmentation for any end discriminative model. In our experiments; we show the efficacy of our approach on both image and text datasets; achieving improvements of 4.0 accuracy points on CIFAR-10; 1.4 F1 points on the ACE relation extraction task; and 3.4 accuracy points when using domain-specific transformation operations on a medical imaging dataset as compared to standard heuristic augmentation approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6916-learning-to-compose-domain-specific-transformations-for-data-augmentation/bibtex,Alexander J.

Differential privacy (DP) has become established as a standard for protecting learning results. The standard DP algorithms require a single trusted party to have access to the entire data; which is a clear weakness; or add prohibitive amounts of noise. We consider DP Bayesian learning in a distributed setting; where each party only holds a single sample or a few samples of the data. We propose a learning strategy based on a secure multi-party sum function for aggregating summaries from data holders and the Gaussian mechanism for DP. Our method builds on an asymptotically optimal and practically efficient DP Bayesian inference with rapidly diminishing extra cost.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6915-differentially-private-bayesian-learning-on-distributed-data/bibtex,Mikko Heikkil?; Eemil Lagerspetz; Samuel Kaski; Kana Shimizu; Sasu Tarkoma; Antti Honkela

We show for the first time that $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ learning bounds can be achieved with only  $O(\sqrt{n}\log n)$  random features rather than $O({n})$  as suggested by previous results. Further;  we prove  faster learning rates and show that they might require more random features; unless they are sampled according to  a possibly problem dependent distribution. Our results shed light on the statistical computational trade-offs in large scale kernelized learning; showing the potential  effectiveness of random features in reducing the computational complexity while keeping optimal generalization properties.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6914-generalization-properties-of-learning-with-random-features/bibtex,Alessandro Rudi; Lorenzo Rosasco

For that purpose; we place ourselves in the framework of policy search algorithms; that are usually designed to maximize the mean value; and derive a method that minimizes the residual $\|T_* v_\pi - v_\pi\|_{1;\nu}$ over policies. A theoretical analysis shows how good this proxy is to policy optimization; and notably that it is better than its value-based counterpart. We also propose experiments on randomly generated generic Markov decision processes; specifically designed for studying the influence of the involved concentrability coefficient. They show that the Bellman residual is generally a bad proxy to policy optimization and that directly maximizing the mean value is much better; despite the current lack of deep theoretical analysis. This might seem obvious; as directly addressing the problem of interest is usually better; but given the prevalence of (projected) Bellman residual minimization in value-based reinforcement learning; we believe that this question is worth to be considered.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6913-is-the-bellman-residual-a-bad-proxy/bibtex,Matthieu Geist; Bilal Piot; Olivier Pietquin

Since it is NP-hard; approximate algorithms are required. In this paper; we present a new algorithm; called Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM); that develops a multiplicative update technique to solve the QP matching problem. MPGM has three main benefits: (1) theoretically; MPGM solves the general QP problem with doubly stochastic constraint naturally whose convergence and KKT optimality are guaranteed. (2) Em- pirically; MPGM generally returns a sparse solution and thus can also incorporate the discrete constraint approximately. (3) It is efficient and simple to implement. Experimental results show the benefits of MPGM algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6911-graph-matching-via-multiplicative-update-algorithm/bibtex,Bo Jiang; Jin Tang; Chris Ding; Yihong Gong; Bin Luo

In this paper; we propose a dynamic importance sampling scheme that provides  anytime finite-sample bounds for the partition function. Our algorithm balances the advantages of the three major inference strategies; heuristic search; variational bounds; and Monte Carlo methods; blending sampling with search to refine a variationally defined proposal. Our algorithm combines and generalizes recent work on anytime search and probabilistic bounds of the partition function. By using an intelligently chosen weighted average over the samples; we construct an unbiased estimator of the partition function with strong finite-sample confidence intervals that inherit both the rapid early improvement rate of sampling and the long-term benefits of an improved proposal from search. This gives significantly improved anytime behavior; and more flexible trade-offs between memory; time; and solution quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach empirically  on real-world problem instances taken from recent UAI competitions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6912-dynamic-importance-sampling-for-anytime-bounds-of-the-partition-function/bibtex,Qi Lou; Rina Dechter; Alexander T.

2017,Net-Trim: Convex Pruning of Deep Neural Networks with Performance Guarantee,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6910-net-trim-convex-pruning-of-deep-neural-networks-with-performance-guarantee.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6910-net-trim-convex-pruning-of-deep-neural-networks-with-performance-guarantee,We introduce and analyze a new technique for model reduction for deep neural networks. While large networks are theoretically capable of learning arbitrarily complex models; overfitting and model redundancy negatively affects the prediction accuracy and model variance.  Our Net-Trim algorithm prunes (sparsifies) a trained network layer-wise; removing connections at each layer by solving a convex optimization program.  This program seeks a sparse set of weights at each layer that keeps the layer inputs and outputs consistent with the originally trained model.  The algorithms and associated analysis are applicable to neural networks operating with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the nonlinear activation. We present both parallel and cascade versions of the algorithm.  While the latter can achieve slightly simpler models with the same generalization performance; the former can be computed in a distributed manner.  In both cases; Net-Trim significantly reduces the number of connections in the network; while also providing enough regularization to slightly reduce the generalization error. We also provide a mathematical analysis of the consistency between the initial network and the retrained model.  To analyze the model sample complexity; we derive the general sufficient conditions for the recovery of a sparse transform matrix. For a single layer taking independent Gaussian random vectors of length $N$ as inputs;  we show that if the network response can be described using a maximum number of $s$ non-zero weights per node; these weights can be learned from $\mathcal{O}(s\log N)$ samples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6910-net-trim-convex-pruning-of-deep-neural-networks-with-performance-guarantee/bibtex,Alireza Aghasi; Afshin Abdi; Nam Nguyen; Justin Romberg
2017,Regret Minimization in MDPs with Options without Prior Knowledge,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6909-regret-minimization-in-mdps-with-options-without-prior-knowledge.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6909-regret-minimization-in-mdps-with-options-without-prior-knowledge,The option framework integrates temporal abstraction into the reinforcement learning model through the introduction of macro-actions (i.e.; options). Recent works leveraged on the mapping of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with options to semi-MDPs (SMDPs) and introduced SMDP-versions of exploration-exploitation algorithms (e.g.; RMAX-SMDP and UCRL-SMDP) to analyze the impact of options on the learning performance. Nonetheless; the PAC-SMDP sample complexity of RMAX-SMDP can hardly be translated into equivalent PAC-MDP theoretical guarantees; while UCRL-SMDP requires prior knowledge of the parameters characterizing the distributions of the cumulative reward and duration of each option; which are hardly available in practice. In this paper; we remove this limitation by combining the SMDP view together with the inner Markov structure of options into a novel algorithm whose regret performance matches UCRL-SMDP's up to an additive regret term. We show scenarios where this term is negligible and the advantage of temporal abstraction is preserved. We also report preliminary empirical result supporting the theoretical findings.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6909-regret-minimization-in-mdps-with-options-without-prior-knowledge/bibtex,Ronan Fruit; Matteo Pirotta; Alessandro Lazaric; Emma Brunskill
2017,Adversarial Ranking for Language Generation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6908-adversarial-ranking-for-language-generation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6908-adversarial-ranking-for-language-generation,Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have great successes on synthesizing data. However; the existing GANs restrict the discriminator to be a binary classifier; and thus limit their learning capacity for tasks that need to synthesize output with rich structures such as natural language descriptions. In this paper; we propose a novel generative adversarial network; RankGAN; for generating high-quality language descriptions. Rather than training the discriminator to learn and assign absolute binary predicate for individual data sample; the proposed RankGAN is able to analyze and rank a collection of human-written and machine-written sentences by giving a reference group. By viewing a set of data samples collectively and evaluating their quality through relative ranking scores; the discriminator is able to make better assessment which in turn helps to learn a better generator. The proposed RankGAN is optimized through the policy gradient technique. Experimental results on multiple public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6908-adversarial-ranking-for-language-generation/bibtex,Kevin Lin; Dianqi Li; Xiaodong He; Zhengyou Zhang; Ming-ting Sun
2017,LightGBM: A Highly Efficient Gradient Boosting Decision Tree,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree,Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm; and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations; the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature; they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points; which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem; we propose two novel techniques: \emph{Gradient-based One-Side Sampling} (GOSS) and \emph{Exclusive Feature Bundling} (EFB). With GOSS; we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients; and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that; since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain; GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB; we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e.; they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously); to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard; but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB \emph{LightGBM}. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that; LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree/bibtex,Guolin Ke; Qi Meng; Thomas Finley; Taifeng Wang; Wei Chen; Weidong Ma; Qiwei Ye; Tie-Yan Liu

In this paper; we present a principled analysis on the support recovery performance for a family of hard thresholding algorithms. To this end; we appeal to the partial hard thresholding (PHT) operator proposed recently by Jain et al. [IEEE Trans. Information Theory; 2017]. We show that under proper conditions; PHT recovers an arbitrary "s"-sparse signal within O(s kappa log kappa) iterations where "kappa" is an appropriate condition number. Specifying the PHT operator; we obtain the best known result for hard thresholding pursuit and orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement. Experiments on the simulated data complement our theoretical findings and also illustrate the effectiveness of PHT compared to other popular recovery methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6905-partial-hard-thresholding-towards-a-principled-analysis-of-support-recovery/bibtex,Jie Shen; Ping Li
2017,Stein Variational Gradient Descent as Gradient Flow,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6904-stein-variational-gradient-descent-as-gradient-flow.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6904-stein-variational-gradient-descent-as-gradient-flow,Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic sampling algorithm that iteratively transports a set of particles to approximate given distributions; based on a  gradient-based update constructed to optimally decrease the KL divergence within a function space. This paper develops the first theoretical analysis on SVGD. We establish that the empirical measures of the SVGD samples weakly converge to the target distribution; and show that the asymptotic behavior of SVGD is characterized by a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation known as Vlasov equation in physics. We develop a geometric perspective that views SVGD as a gradient flow of the KL divergence functional under a new metric structure on the space of distributions induced by Stein operator.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6904-stein-variational-gradient-descent-as-gradient-flow/bibtex,Qiang Liu
2017,Shallow Updates for Deep Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6906-shallow-updates-for-deep-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6906-shallow-updates-for-deep-reinforcement-learning,Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods such as the Deep Q-Network (DQN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of challenging; high-dimensional domains. This success is mainly attributed to the power of deep neural networks to learn rich domain representations for approximating the value function or policy.  Batch reinforcement learning methods with linear representations; on the other hand; are more stable and require less hyper parameter tuning. Yet; substantial feature engineering is necessary to achieve good results. In this work we propose a hybrid approach -- the Least Squares Deep Q-Network (LS-DQN); which combines rich feature representations learned by a DRL algorithm with the stability of a linear least squares method. We do this by periodically re-training the last hidden layer of a DRL network with a batch least squares update. Key to our approach is a Bayesian regularization term for the least squares update; which prevents over-fitting to the more recent data. We tested LS-DQN on five Atari games and demonstrate significant improvement over vanilla DQN and Double-DQN. We also investigated the reasons for the superior performance of our method. Interestingly; we found that the performance improvement can be attributed to the large batch size used by the LS method when optimizing the last layer.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6906-shallow-updates-for-deep-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Nir Levine; Tom Zahavy; Daniel J.

2017,Unbiased estimates for linear regression via volume sampling,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6901-unbiased-estimates-for-linear-regression-via-volume-sampling.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6901-unbiased-estimates-for-linear-regression-via-volume-sampling,Given a full rank matrix X with more columns than rows consider the task of estimating the pseudo inverse $X^+$ based  on the pseudo inverse of a sampled subset of columns (of size at least the number of rows). We show that this is possible if the subset of columns is chosen proportional to the squared volume spanned by the rows of the chosen submatrix (ie; volume sampling). The resulting estimator is unbiased and surprisingly the covariance of the estimator also has a closed form: It equals a specific factor times $X^+X^{+\top}$.  Pseudo inverse plays an important part in solving the linear least squares problem; where we try to predict a label for each column of $X$. We assume labels are expensive and we are only given the labels for the small subset of columns we sample from $X$. Using our methods we show that the weight vector of the solution for the sub problem is an unbiased estimator of the optimal solution for the whole problem based on all  column labels.   We believe that these new formulas establish a fundamental connection between linear least squares and volume sampling. We use our methods to obtain an algorithm for volume sampling that is faster than state-of-the-art and for obtaining bounds for the total loss of the estimated least-squares solution on all labeled columns.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6901-unbiased-estimates-for-linear-regression-via-volume-sampling/bibtex,Michal Derezinski; Manfred K.

Focussing on large complex public transportation systems; we build a scalable model that exploits input-output information to estimate the unobserved link/station loads and the users path preferences. Based on the reconstruction of the users' travel time distribution; the model is flexible enough to capture possible different path-choice strategies and correlations between users travelling on similar paths at similar times. The corresponding likelihood function is intractable for medium or large-scale networks and we propose two distinct strategies; namely the exact maximum-likelihood inference of an approximate but tractable model and the variational inference of the original intractable model. As an application of our approach; we consider the emblematic case of the London Underground network; where a tap-in/tap-out system tracks the start/exit time and location of all journeys in a day. A set of synthetic simulations and real data provided by Transport For London are used to validate and test the model on the predictions of observable and unobservable quantities.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6899-tomography-of-the-london-underground-a-scalable-model-for-origin-destination-data/bibtex,Nicol?

2017,Adaptive Accelerated Gradient Converging Method under H\&quot;{o}lderian Error Bound Condition,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6903-adaptive-accelerated-gradient-converging-method-under-holderian-error-bound-condition.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6903-adaptive-accelerated-gradient-converging-method-under-holderian-error-bound-condition,Recent studies have shown that proximal gradient (PG) method and accelerated gradient method (APG) with restarting can enjoy a linear convergence under a weaker condition than strong convexity; namely a quadratic growth condition (QGC). However; the faster convergence of restarting APG method relies on the potentially unknown constant  in QGC to appropriately restart APG; which restricts its applicability. We address this issue by developing a novel adaptive gradient converging methods; i.e.; leveraging  the magnitude of proximal gradient as a criterion for restart and termination. Our analysis extends to a much more general condition beyond the QGC; namely the H\"{o}lderian error bound (HEB) condition.   {\it The key technique} for our development is a novel synthesis of  {\it adaptive regularization and a conditional restarting scheme}; which extends previous work focusing on strongly convex problems to a much broader family of problems. Furthermore; we demonstrate that our results have important implication and applications in machine learning: (i) if the objective function is coercive and semi-algebraic; PG's convergence speed is essentially $o(\frac{1}{t})$; where $t$ is the total number of iterations; (ii) if the objective function consists of an $\ell_1$; $\ell_\infty$; $\ell_{1;\infty}$; or huber  norm regularization and a convex smooth piecewise quadratic loss (e.g.; square loss; squared hinge loss and huber loss); the proposed algorithm is parameter-free and enjoys a {\it faster linear convergence} than PG without any other assumptions  (e.g.; restricted eigen-value condition).   It is notable that  our linear convergence results for the aforementioned problems  are global instead of local.  To the best of our knowledge; these improved results are first shown in this work.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6903-adaptive-accelerated-gradient-converging-method-under-holderian-error-bound-condition/bibtex,Mingrui Liu; Tianbao Yang
2017,Rotting Bandits,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6900-rotting-bandits.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6900-rotting-bandits,The Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) framework highlights the trade-off between acquiring new knowledge (Exploration) and leveraging available knowledge (Exploitation). In the classical MAB problem; a decision maker must choose an arm at each time step; upon which she receives a reward. The decision maker's objective is to maximize her cumulative expected reward over the time horizon. The MAB problem has been studied extensively; specifically under the assumption of the arms' rewards distributions being stationary; or quasi-stationary; over time. We consider a variant of the MAB framework; which we termed Rotting Bandits; where each arm's expected reward decays as a function of the number of times it has been pulled. We are motivated by many real-world scenarios such as online advertising; content recommendation; crowdsourcing; and more. We present algorithms; accompanied by simulations; and derive theoretical guarantees.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6900-rotting-bandits/bibtex,Nir Levine; Koby Crammer; Shie Mannor

Despite its widespread use; the method has an underdeveloped analytical foundation. Having a well understood foundation would both support the currently used methods and help guide future improvements. The goal of this paper is to give an analytic framework to better understand observations seen in practice. This paper considers the dual of a problem framework for hierarchical clustering introduced by Dasgupta. The main result is that one of the most popular algorithms used in practice; average linkage agglomerative clustering; has a small constant approximation ratio for this objective. Furthermore; this paper establishes that using bisecting k-means divisive clustering has a very poor lower bound on its approximation ratio for the same objective.  However; we show that there are divisive algorithms that perform well with respect to this objective by giving two constant approximation algorithms. This paper is some of the first work to establish guarantees on widely used hierarchical algorithms for a natural objective function.  This objective and analysis give insight into what these popular algorithms are optimizing and when they will perform well.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6902-approximation-bounds-for-hierarchical-clustering-average-linkage-bisecting-k-means-and-local-search/bibtex,Benjamin Moseley; Joshua Wang
2017,Hierarchical Attentive Recurrent Tracking,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6898-hierarchical-attentive-recurrent-tracking.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6898-hierarchical-attentive-recurrent-tracking,Class-agnostic object tracking is particularly difficult in cluttered environments as target specific discriminative models cannot be learned a priori. Inspired by how the human visual cortex employs spatial attention and separate ``where'' and ``what'' processing pathways to actively suppress irrelevant visual features; this work develops a hierarchical attentive recurrent model for single object tracking in videos. The first layer of attention discards the majority of background by selecting a region containing the object of interest; while the subsequent layers tune in on visual features particular to the tracked object.    This framework is fully differentiable and can be trained in a purely data driven fashion by gradient methods. To improve training convergence; we augment the loss function with terms for auxiliary tasks relevant for tracking. Evaluation of the proposed model is performed on two datasets: pedestrian tracking on the KTH activity recognition dataset and the more difficult KITTI object tracking dataset.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6898-hierarchical-attentive-recurrent-tracking/bibtex,Adam Kosiorek; Alex Bewley; Ingmar Posner

We address this problem by   extending the framework of robust MDPs to the model-free   Reinforcement Learning setting; where we do not have access to the   model parameters; but can only sample states from it.  We define   robust versions of Q-learning; Sarsa; and   TD-learning and prove convergence to an approximately optimal   robust policy and approximate value function respectively.  We scale   up the robust algorithms to large MDPs via function approximation   and prove convergence under two different settings. We prove   convergence of robust approximate policy iteration and robust   approximate value iteration for linear architectures (under mild   assumptions). We also define a   robust loss function; the mean squared robust projected     Bellman error and give stochastic gradient descent algorithms   that are guaranteed to converge to a local minimum.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6897-reinforcement-learning-under-model-mismatch/bibtex,Aurko Roy; Huan Xu; Sebastian Pokutta

Specifically; we aim to learn the set of "best influencers" in a social network online while repeatedly interacting with it. We address the challenges of (i) combinatorial action space; since the number of feasible influencer sets grows exponentially with the maximum number of influencers; and (ii) limited feedback; since only the influenced portion of the network is observed. Under a stochastic semi-bandit feedback; we propose and analyze IMLinUCB; a computationally efficient UCB-based algorithm. Our bounds on the cumulative regret are polynomial in all quantities of interest; achieve near-optimal dependence on the number of interactions and reflect the topology of the network and the activation probabilities of its edges; thereby giving insights on the problem complexity. To the best of our knowledge; these are the first such results. Our experiments show that in several representative graph topologies; the regret of IMLinUCB scales as suggested by our upper bounds. IMLinUCB permits linear generalization and thus is both statistically and computationally suitable for large-scale problems. Our experiments also show that IMLinUCB with linear generalization can lead to low regret in real-world online influence maximization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6895-online-influence-maximization-under-independent-cascade-model-with-semi-bandit-feedback/bibtex,Zheng Wen; Branislav Kveton; Michal Valko; Sharan Vaswani

It has been conjectured that a simple adversary strategy; called COMB; is near optimal in this game for any number of experts. Our results and new insights make progress in this direction by showing that; up to a small additive term; COMB is minimax optimal in the finite-time three expert problem. In addition; we provide for this setting a new near minimax optimal COMB-based learner. Prior to this work; in this problem; learners obtaining the optimal multiplicative constant in their regret rate were known only when $K=2$ or $K\rightarrow\infty$. We characterize; when $K=3$; the regret of the game scaling as $\sqrt{8/(9\pi)T}\pm \log(T)^2$ which gives for the first time the optimal constant in the leading ($\sqrt{T}$) term of the regret.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6896-near-minimax-optimal-players-for-the-finite-time-3-expert-prediction-problem/bibtex,Yasin Abbasi; Peter L.

2017,AIDE: An algorithm for measuring the accuracy of probabilistic inference algorithms,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6893-aide-an-algorithm-for-measuring-the-accuracy-of-probabilistic-inference-algorithms.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6893-aide-an-algorithm-for-measuring-the-accuracy-of-probabilistic-inference-algorithms,Approximate probabilistic inference algorithms are central to many fields. Examples include sequential Monte Carlo inference in robotics; variational inference in machine learning; and Markov chain Monte Carlo inference in statistics. A key problem faced by practitioners is measuring the accuracy of an approximate inference algorithm on a specific data set. This paper introduces the auxiliary inference divergence estimator (AIDE); an algorithm for measuring the accuracy of approximate inference algorithms. AIDE is based on the observation that inference algorithms can be treated as probabilistic models and the random variables used within the inference algorithm can be viewed as auxiliary variables. This view leads to a new estimator for the symmetric KL divergence between the approximating distributions of two inference algorithms. The paper illustrates application of AIDE to algorithms for inference in regression; hidden Markov; and Dirichlet process mixture models. The experiments show that AIDE captures the qualitative behavior of a broad class of inference algorithms and can detect failure modes of inference algorithms that are missed by standard heuristics.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6893-aide-an-algorithm-for-measuring-the-accuracy-of-probabilistic-inference-algorithms/bibtex,Marco Cusumano-Towner; Vikash K.

We introduce the idea of using the invariance of the functional relations of the variables to their causes across a set of environments for structure learning. We define a notion of completeness for a causal inference algorithm in this setting and prove the existence of such algorithm by proposing the baseline algorithm. Additionally; we present an alternate algorithm that has significantly improved computational and sample complexity compared to the baseline algorithm.

As a starting point; we show improvements over the two state-of-the-art approaches for single-speaker neural TTS: Deep Voice 1 and Tacotron. We introduce Deep Voice 2; which is based on a similar pipeline with Deep Voice 1; but constructed with higher performance building blocks and demonstrates a significant audio quality improvement over Deep Voice 1. We improve Tacotron by introducing a post-processing neural vocoder; and demonstrate a significant audio quality improvement. We then demonstrate our technique for multi-speaker speech synthesis for both Deep Voice 2 and Tacotron on two multi-speaker TTS datasets. We show that a single neural TTS system can learn hundreds of unique voices from less than half an hour of data per speaker; while achieving high audio quality synthesis and preserving the speaker identities almost perfectly.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6889-deep-voice-2-multi-speaker-neural-text-to-speech/bibtex,Andrew Gibiansky; Sercan Arik; Gregory Diamos; John Miller; Kainan Peng; Wei Ping; Jonathan Raiman; Yanqi Zhou

In some settings; the structure of a problem allows a distributed solution with limited communication. Here; we consider a scenario where no communication is available; and instead we learn local policies for all agents that collectively mimic the solution to a centralized multi-agent static optimization problem. Our main contribution is an information theoretic framework based on rate distortion theory which facilitates analysis of how well the resulting fully decentralized policies are able to reconstruct the optimal solution. Moreover; this framework provides a natural extension that addresses which nodes an agent should communicate with to improve the  performance of its individual policy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6887-fully-decentralized-policies-for-multi-agent-systems-an-information-theoretic-approach/bibtex,Roel Dobbe; David Fridovich-Keil; Claire Tomlin

Although simply replaying all previous data alleviates the problem; it requires large memory and even worse; often infeasible in real world applications where the access to past data is limited. Inspired by the generative nature of the hippocampus as a short-term memory system in primate brain; we propose the Deep Generative Replay; a novel framework with a cooperative dual model architecture consisting of a deep generative model (?generator?) and a task solving model (?solver?). With only these two models; training data for previous tasks can easily be sampled and interleaved with those for a new task.

Our approach builds off of techniques for distributionally robust optimization and Owen's empirical likelihood; and we provide a number of finite-sample and asymptotic results characterizing the theoretical performance of the estimator. In particular; we show that our procedure comes with certificates of optimality; achieving (in some scenarios) faster rates of convergence than empirical risk minimization by virtue of automatically balancing bias and variance. We give corroborating empirical evidence showing that in practice; the estimator indeed trades between variance and absolute performance on a training sample; improving out-of-sample (test) performance over standard empirical risk minimization for a number of classification problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6890-variance-based-regularization-with-convex-objectives/bibtex,Hongseok Namkoong; John C.

Given i.i.d samples from the joint distribution $f(x;y;z)$ of continuous random vectors $X;Y$ and $Z;$ we determine whether $X \independent Y \vert Z$. We approach this by converting the conditional independence test into a classification problem.  This allows us to harness very powerful classifiers like gradient-boosted trees and deep neural networks.  These models can handle complex probability distributions and allow us to perform significantly better compared to the prior state of the art; for high-dimensional CI testing. The main technical challenge in the classification problem is the need for samples from the conditional product distribution $f^{CI}(x;y;z) = f(x|z)f(y|z)f(z)$ -- the joint distribution if and only if $X \independent Y \vert Z.$ -- when given access only to i.i.d.  samples from the true joint distribution $f(x;y;z)$.  To tackle this problem we propose a novel nearest neighbor bootstrap procedure and theoretically show that our generated samples are indeed close to $f^{CI}$ in terms of total variational distance. We then develop theoretical results regarding the generalization bounds for classification for our problem; which translate into error bounds for CI testing. We provide a novel analysis of Rademacher type classification bounds in the presence of non-i.i.d \textit{near-independent} samples. We empirically validate the performance of our algorithm on simulated and real datasets and show performance gains over previous methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6888-model-powered-conditional-independence-test/bibtex,Rajat Sen; Ananda Theertha Suresh; Karthikeyan Shanmugam; Alexandros G.

2017,A PAC-Bayesian Analysis of Randomized Learning with Application to Stochastic Gradient Descent,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6886-a-pac-bayesian-analysis-of-randomized-learning-with-application-to-stochastic-gradient-descent.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6886-a-pac-bayesian-analysis-of-randomized-learning-with-application-to-stochastic-gradient-descent,We study the generalization error of randomized learning algorithms -- focusing on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) -- using a novel combination of PAC-Bayes and algorithmic stability. Importantly; our generalization bounds hold for all posterior distributions on an algorithm's random hyperparameters; including distributions that depend on the training data. This inspires an adaptive sampling algorithm for SGD that optimizes the posterior at runtime. We analyze this algorithm in the context of our generalization bounds and evaluate it on a benchmark dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive sampling can reduce empirical risk faster than uniform sampling while also improving out-of-sample accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6886-a-pac-bayesian-analysis-of-randomized-learning-with-application-to-stochastic-gradient-descent/bibtex,Ben London
2017,Beyond Parity: Fairness Objectives for Collaborative Filtering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6885-beyond-parity-fairness-objectives-for-collaborative-filtering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6885-beyond-parity-fairness-objectives-for-collaborative-filtering,We study fairness in collaborative-filtering recommender systems; which are sensitive to discrimination that exists in historical data. Biased data can lead collaborative-filtering methods to make unfair predictions for users from minority groups. We identify the insufficiency of existing fairness metrics and propose four new metrics that address different forms of unfairness. These fairness metrics can be optimized by adding fairness terms to the learning objective. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our new metrics can better measure fairness than the baseline; and that the fairness objectives effectively help reduce unfairness.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6885-beyond-parity-fairness-objectives-for-collaborative-filtering/bibtex,Sirui Yao; Bert Huang
2017,State Aware Imitation Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6884-state-aware-imitation-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6884-state-aware-imitation-learning,Imitation learning is the study of learning how to act given a set of demonstrations provided by a human expert. It is intuitively apparent that learning to take optimal actions is a simpler undertaking in situations that are similar to the ones shown by the teacher. However; imitation learning approaches do not tend to use this insight directly. In this paper; we introduce State Aware Imitation Learning (SAIL); an imitation learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn how to remain in states where it can confidently take the correct action and how to recover if it is lead astray. Key to this algorithm is a gradient learned using a temporal difference update rule which leads the agent to prefer states similar to the demonstrated states. We show that estimating a linear approximation of this gradient yields similar theoretical guarantees to online temporal difference learning approaches and empirically show that SAIL can effectively be used for imitation learning in continuous domains with non-linear function approximators used for both the policy representation and the gradient estimate.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6884-state-aware-imitation-learning/bibtex,Yannick Schroecker; Charles L.

2017,Robust Estimation of Neural Signals in Calcium Imaging,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6883-robust-estimation-of-neural-signals-in-calcium-imaging.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6883-robust-estimation-of-neural-signals-in-calcium-imaging,Calcium imaging is a prominent technology in neuroscience research which allows for simultaneous recording of large numbers of neurons in awake animals. Automated extraction of neurons and their temporal activity from imaging datasets is an important step in the path to producing neuroscience results. However; nearly all imaging datasets contain gross contaminating sources which could originate from the technology used; or the underlying biological tissue. Although past work has considered the effects of contamination under limited circumstances; there has not been a general framework treating contamination and its effects on the statistical estimation of calcium signals. In this work; we proceed in a new direction and propose to extract cells and their activity using robust statistical estimation. Using the theory of M-estimation; we derive a minimax optimal robust loss;  and also find a simple and practical optimization routine for this loss with provably fast convergence. We use our proposed robust loss in a matrix factorization framework to extract the neurons and their temporal activity in calcium imaging datasets. We demonstrate the superiority of our robust estimation approach over existing methods on both simulated and real datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6883-robust-estimation-of-neural-signals-in-calcium-imaging/bibtex,Hakan Inan; Murat A.

2017,Gauging Variational Inference,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6881-gauging-variational-inference.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6881-gauging-variational-inference,Computing partition function is the most important statistical inference task arising in applications of Graphical Models (GM). Since it is computationally intractable; approximate  methods have been used in practice; where mean-field  (MF) and belief propagation (BP) are arguably the most popular and successful approaches of a variational type. In this paper; we propose two new variational schemes; coined Gauged-MF (G-MF) and Gauged-BP (G-BP); improving MF and BP; respectively. Both provide lower bounds for the partition function by utilizing the so-called gauge transformation which modifies factors of GM while keeping the partition function invariant. Moreover; we prove that both G-MF and G-BP are exact for GMs with a single loop of a special structure; even though the bare MF and BP perform badly in this case. Our extensive experiments indeed confirm that the proposed algorithms outperform and generalize MF and BP.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6881-gauging-variational-inference/bibtex,Sung-Soo Ahn; Michael Chertkov; Jinwoo Shin

2017,Cold-Start Reinforcement Learning with Softmax Policy Gradient,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6874-cold-start-reinforcement-learning-with-softmax-policy-gradient.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6874-cold-start-reinforcement-learning-with-softmax-policy-gradient,Policy-gradient approaches to reinforcement learning have two common and undesirable overhead procedures; namely warm-start training and sample variance reduction. In this paper; we describe a reinforcement learning method based on a softmax value function that requires neither of these procedures. Our method combines the advantages of policy-gradient methods with the efficiency and simplicity of maximum-likelihood approaches. We apply this new cold-start reinforcement learning method in training sequence generation models for structured output prediction problems. Empirical evidence validates this method on automatic summarization and image captioning tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6874-cold-start-reinforcement-learning-with-softmax-policy-gradient/bibtex,Nan Ding; Radu Soricut
2017,Convolutional Gaussian Processes,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6877-convolutional-gaussian-processes.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6877-convolutional-gaussian-processes,We present a practical way of introducing convolutional structure into Gaussian processes; making them more suited to high-dimensional inputs like images. The main contribution of our work is the construction of an inter-domain inducing point approximation that is well-tailored to the convolutional kernel. This allows us to gain the generalisation benefit of a convolutional kernel; together with fast but accurate posterior inference. We investigate several variations of the convolutional kernel; and apply it to MNIST and CIFAR-10; where we obtain significant improvements over existing Gaussian process models. We also show how the marginal likelihood can be used to find an optimal weighting between convolutional and RBF kernels to further improve performance. This illustration of the usefulness of the marginal likelihood may help automate discovering architectures in larger models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6877-convolutional-gaussian-processes/bibtex,Mark van der Wilk; Carl Edward Rasmussen; James Hensman
2017,Online Dynamic Programming,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6875-online-dynamic-programming.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6875-online-dynamic-programming,We consider the problem of repeatedly solving a variant of the same dynamic programming problem in successive trials. An instance of the type of problems we consider is to find a good binary search tree in a changing environment. At the beginning of each trial; the learner probabilistically chooses a tree with the n keys at the internal nodes and the n + 1 gaps between keys at the leaves. The learner is then told the frequencies of the keys and gaps and is charged by the average search cost for the chosen tree. The problem is online because the frequencies can change between trials. The goal is to develop algorithms with the property that their total average search cost (loss) in all trials is close to the total loss of the best tree chosen in hindsight for all trials. The challenge; of course; is that the algorithm has to deal with exponential number of trees. We develop a general methodology for tackling such problems for a wide class of dynamic programming algorithms. Our framework allows us to extend online learning algorithms like Hedge and Component Hedge to a significantly wider class of combinatorial objects than was possible before.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6875-online-dynamic-programming/bibtex,Holakou Rahmanian; Manfred K.

2017,Alternating Estimation for Structured High-Dimensional Multi-Response Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6876-alternating-estimation-for-structured-high-dimensional-multi-response-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6876-alternating-estimation-for-structured-high-dimensional-multi-response-models,We consider the problem of learning high-dimensional multi-response linear models with structured parameters. By exploiting the noise correlations among different responses; we propose an alternating estimation (AltEst) procedure to estimate the model parameters based on the generalized Dantzig selector (GDS). Under suitable sample size and resampling assumptions; we show that the error of the estimates generated by AltEst; with high probability; converges linearly to certain minimum achievable level; which can be tersely expressed by a few geometric measures; such as Gaussian width of sets related to the parameter structure. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first non-asymptotic statistical guarantee for such AltEst-type algorithm applied to estimation with general structures.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6876-alternating-estimation-for-structured-high-dimensional-multi-response-models/bibtex,Sheng Chen; Arindam Banerjee
2017,Deep Recurrent Neural Network-Based Identification of Precursor microRNAs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6882-deep-recurrent-neural-network-based-identification-of-precursor-micrornas.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6882-deep-recurrent-neural-network-based-identification-of-precursor-micrornas,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) which play key roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Direct identification of mature miRNAs is infeasible due to their short lengths; and researchers instead aim at identifying precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Many of the known pre-miRNAs have distinctive stem-loop secondary structure; and structure-based filtering is usually the first step to predict the possibility of a given sequence being a pre-miRNA. To identify new pre-miRNAs that often have non-canonical structure; however; we need to consider additional features other than structure. To obtain such additional characteristics; existing computational methods rely on manual feature extraction; which inevitably limits the efficiency; robustness; and generalization of computational identification. To address the limitations of existing approaches; we propose a pre-miRNA identification method that incorporates (1) a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for automated feature learning and classification; (2) multimodal architecture for seamless integration of prior knowledge (secondary structure); (3) an attention mechanism for improving long-term dependence modeling; and (4) an RNN-based class activation mapping for highlighting the learned representations that can contrast pre-miRNAs and non-pre-miRNAs. In our experiments with recent benchmarks; the proposed approach outperformed the compared state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of various performance metrics.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6882-deep-recurrent-neural-network-based-identification-of-precursor-micrornas/bibtex,Seunghyun Park; Seonwoo Min; Hyun-Soo Choi; Sungroh Yoon
2017,A Bayesian Data Augmentation Approach for Learning Deep Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6872-a-bayesian-data-augmentation-approach-for-learning-deep-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6872-a-bayesian-data-augmentation-approach-for-learning-deep-models,Data augmentation is an essential part of the training process applied to deep learning models.  The motivation is that a robust training process for deep learning models depends on large annotated datasets; which are expensive to be acquired; stored and processed.  Therefore a reasonable alternative is to be able to automatically generate new annotated training samples using a process known as data augmentation. The dominant data augmentation approach in the field assumes that new training samples can be obtained via random geometric or appearance transformations applied to annotated training samples; but this is a strong assumption because it is unclear if this is a reliable generative model for producing new training samples. In this paper; we provide a novel Bayesian formulation to data augmentation; where new annotated training points are treated as missing variables and generated based on the distribution learned from the training set. For learning; we introduce a theoretically sound algorithm --- generalised Monte Carlo expectation maximisation; and demonstrate one possible implementation via an extension of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Classification results on MNIST; CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show the better performance of our proposed method compared to the current dominant data augmentation approach mentioned above --- the results also show that our approach produces better classification results than similar GAN models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6872-a-bayesian-data-augmentation-approach-for-learning-deep-models/bibtex,Toan Tran; Trung Pham; Gustavo Carneiro; Lyle Palmer; Ian Reid
2017,Estimation of the covariance structure of heavy-tailed distributions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6878-estimation-of-the-covariance-structure-of-heavy-tailed-distributions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6878-estimation-of-the-covariance-structure-of-heavy-tailed-distributions,We propose and analyze a new estimator of the covariance matrix that admits strong theoretical guarantees under weak assumptions on the underlying distribution; such as existence of moments of only low order. While estimation of covariance matrices corresponding to sub-Gaussian distributions is well-understood; much less in known in the case of heavy-tailed data.  As K. Balasubramanian and M. Yuan write; ``data from real-world experiments oftentimes tend to be corrupted with outliers and/or exhibit heavy tails. In such cases; it is not clear that those covariance matrix estimators .. remain optimal'' and ``..what are the other possible strategies to deal with heavy tailed distributions warrant further studies.'' We make a step towards answering this question and prove tight deviation inequalities for the proposed estimator that depend only on the parameters controlling the ``intrinsic dimension'' associated to the covariance matrix (as opposed to the dimension of the ambient space); in particular; our results are applicable in the case of high-dimensional observations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6878-estimation-of-the-covariance-structure-of-heavy-tailed-distributions/bibtex,Xiaohan Wei; Stanislav Minsker
2017,Principles of Riemannian Geometry  in Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6873-principles-of-riemannian-geometry-in-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6873-principles-of-riemannian-geometry-in-neural-networks,This study deals with neural networks in the sense of geometric transformations acting on the coordinate representation of the underlying data manifold which the data is sampled from. It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of neural networks in the setting of Riemannian geometry. From this perspective; the following theoretical results are developed and proven for feedforward networks. First it is shown that residual neural networks are finite difference approximations to dynamical systems of first order differential equations; as opposed to ordinary networks that are static. This implies that the network is learning systems of differential equations governing the coordinate transformations that represent the data. Second it is shown that a closed form solution of the metric tensor on the underlying data manifold can be found by backpropagating the coordinate representations learned by the neural network itself. This is formulated in a formal abstract sense as a sequence of Lie group actions on the metric fibre space in the principal and associated bundles on the data manifold. Toy experiments were run to confirm parts of the proposed theory; as well as to provide intuitions as to how neural networks operate on data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6873-principles-of-riemannian-geometry-in-neural-networks/bibtex,Michael Hauser; Asok Ray
2017,Bridging the Gap Between Value and Policy Based Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6870-bridging-the-gap-between-value-and-policy-based-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6870-bridging-the-gap-between-value-and-policy-based-reinforcement-learning,We establish a new connection between value and policy based reinforcement learning (RL) based on a relationship between softmax temporal value consistency and policy optimality under entropy regularization. Specifically; we show that softmax consistent action values correspond to optimal entropy regularized policy probabilities along any action sequence; regardless of provenance. From this observation; we develop a new RL algorithm; Path Consistency Learning (PCL); that minimizes a notion of soft consistency error along multi-step action sequences extracted from both on- and off-policy traces. We examine the behavior of PCL in different scenarios and show that PCL can be interpreted as generalizing both actor-critic and Q-learning algorithms. We subsequently deepen the relationship by showing how a single model can be used to represent both a policy and the corresponding softmax state values; eliminating the need for a separate critic. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that PCL significantly outperforms strong actor-critic and Q-learning baselines across several benchmarks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6870-bridging-the-gap-between-value-and-policy-based-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Ofir Nachum; Mohammad Norouzi; Kelvin Xu; Dale Schuurmans
2017,Variational Inference via \chi Upper Bound Minimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6866-variational-inference-via-chi-upper-bound-minimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6866-variational-inference-via-chi-upper-bound-minimization,Variational inference (VI) is widely used as an efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo. It posits a family of approximating distributions $q$ and finds the closest member to the exact posterior $p$. Closeness is usually measured via a divergence $D(q || p)$ from $q$ to $p$. While successful; this approach also has problems. Notably; it typically leads to underestimation of the posterior variance. In this paper we propose CHIVI; a black-box variational inference algorithm that minimizes $D_{\chi}(p || q)$; the $\chi$-divergence from $p$ to $q$. CHIVI minimizes an upper bound of the model evidence; which we term the $\chi$ upper bound (CUBO). Minimizing the CUBO leads to improved posterior uncertainty; and it can also be used with the classical VI lower bound (ELBO) to provide a sandwich estimate of the model evidence. We study CHIVI on three models: probit regression; Gaussian process classification; and a Cox process model of basketball plays. When compared to expectation propagation and classical VI; CHIVI produces better error rates and more accurate estimates of posterior variance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6866-variational-inference-via-chi-upper-bound-minimization/bibtex,Adji Bousso Dieng; Dustin Tran; Rajesh Ranganath; John Paisley; David Blei
2017,An Empirical Bayes Approach to Optimizing Machine Learning Algorithms,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6864-an-empirical-bayes-approach-to-optimizing-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6864-an-empirical-bayes-approach-to-optimizing-machine-learning-algorithms,There is rapidly growing interest in using Bayesian optimization to tune model and inference hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms that take a long time to run. For example; Spearmint is a popular software package for selecting the optimal number of layers and learning rate in neural networks. But given that there is uncertainty about which hyperparameters give the best predictive performance; and given that fitting a model for each choice of hyperparameters is costly; it is arguably wasteful to "throw away" all but the best result; as per Bayesian optimization. A related issue is the danger of overfitting the validation data when optimizing many hyperparameters. In this paper; we consider an alternative approach that uses more samples from the hyperparameter selection procedure to average over the uncertainty in model hyperparameters. The resulting approach; empirical Bayes for hyperparameter averaging (EB-Hyp) predicts held-out data better than Bayesian optimization in two experiments on latent Dirichlet allocation and deep latent Gaussian models. EB-Hyp suggests a simpler approach to evaluating and deploying machine learning algorithms that does not require a separate validation data set and hyperparameter selection procedure.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6864-an-empirical-bayes-approach-to-optimizing-machine-learning-algorithms/bibtex,James McInerney

Nevertheless in practice their ways of choosing the appropriate function class differ. Specifically neural networks learn a representation by adapting their basis functions to the data and the task at hand; while kernel methods typically use a basis that is not adapted during training. In this work; we contrast random features of approximated kernel machines with learned features of neural networks. Our analysis reveals how these random and adaptive basis functions affect the quality of learning. Furthermore; we present basis adaptation schemes that allow for a more compact representation; while retaining the generalization properties of kernel machines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6869-an-empirical-study-on-the-properties-of-random-bases-for-kernel-methods/bibtex,Maximilian Alber; Pieter-Jan Kindermans; Kristof Sch?tt; Klaus-Robert M?ller; Fei Sha

2017,VAIN: Attentional Multi-agent Predictive Modeling,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6863-vain-attentional-multi-agent-predictive-modeling.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6863-vain-attentional-multi-agent-predictive-modeling,Multi-agent predictive modeling is an essential step for understanding physical; social and team-play systems. Recently; Interaction Networks (INs) were proposed for the task of modeling multi-agent physical systems. One of the drawbacks of INs is scaling with the number of interactions in the system (typically quadratic or higher order in the number of agents). In this paper we introduce VAIN; a novel attentional architecture for multi-agent predictive modeling that scales linearly with the number of agents. We show that VAIN is effective for multi-agent predictive modeling. Our method is evaluated on tasks from challenging multi-agent prediction domains: chess and soccer; and outperforms competing multi-agent approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6863-vain-attentional-multi-agent-predictive-modeling/bibtex,Yedid Hoshen
2017,#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6868-exploration-a-study-of-count-based-exploration-for-deep-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6868-exploration-a-study-of-count-based-exploration-for-deep-reinforcement-learning,Count-based exploration algorithms are known to perform near-optimally when used in conjunction with tabular reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solving small discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is generally thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state spaces; since most states will only occur once. Recent deep RL exploration strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces through complex heuristics; often relying on optimism in the face of uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. In this work; we describe a surprising finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous deep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes; which allows to count their occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a reward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find that simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many challenging tasks. Furthermore; we show that a domain-dependent learned hash code may further improve these results. Detailed analysis reveals important aspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2) encoding information relevant to solving the MDP. This exploration strategy achieves near state-of-the-art performance on both continuous control tasks and Atari 2600 games; hence providing a simple yet powerful baseline for solving MDPs that require considerable exploration.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6868-exploration-a-study-of-count-based-exploration-for-deep-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Haoran Tang; Rein Houthooft; Davis Foote; Adam Stooke; OpenAI Xi Chen; Yan Duan; John Schulman; Filip DeTurck; Pieter Abbeel

Our proposed algorithm integrates the proximal newton algorithm with multi-stage convex relaxation based on the difference of convex (DC) programming;  and enjoys both strong computational and statistical guarantees. Specifically; by leveraging a sophisticated characterization of sparse modeling structures (i.e.; local restricted strong convexity and Hessian smoothness); we prove that within each stage of convex relaxation; our proposed algorithm achieves (local) quadratic convergence; and eventually obtains a sparse approximate local optimum with optimal statistical properties after only a few convex relaxations. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theory.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6867-on-quadratic-convergence-of-dc-proximal-newton-algorithm-in-nonconvex-sparse-learning/bibtex,Xingguo Li; Lin Yang; Jason Ge; Jarvis Haupt; Tong Zhang; Tuo Zhao
2017,Dynamic Revenue Sharing,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6861-dynamic-revenue-sharing.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6861-dynamic-revenue-sharing,Many online platforms act as intermediaries between a seller and a set of buyers. Examples of such settings include online retailers (such as Ebay) selling items on behalf of sellers to buyers; or advertising exchanges (such as AdX) selling pageviews on behalf of publishers to advertisers. In such settings; revenue sharing is a central part of running such a marketplace for the intermediary; and fixed-percentage revenue sharing schemes are often used to split the revenue among the platform and the sellers. In particular; such revenue sharing schemes require the platform to (i) take at most a constant fraction \alpha of the revenue from auctions and (ii) pay the seller at least the seller declared opportunity cost c for each item sold. A straightforward way to satisfy the constraints is to set a reserve price at c / (1 - \alpha) for each item; but it is not the optimal solution on maximizing the profit of the intermediary.  While previous studies (by Mirrokni and Gomes; and by Niazadeh et al) focused on revenue-sharing schemes in static double auctions; in this paper; we take advantage of the repeated nature of the auctions. In particular; we introduce dynamic revenue sharing schemes where we balance the two constraints over different auctions to achieve higher profit and seller revenue. This is directly motivated by the practice of advertising exchanges where the fixed-percentage revenue-share should be met across all auctions and not in each auction. In this paper; we characterize the optimal revenue sharing scheme that satisfies both constraints in expectation.

For smooth (strongly) convex loss function with or without (non)-smooth regularization; we give algorithms which achieve either optimal or near optimal utility bound with less gradient complexity compared with previous work.  For ERM with smooth convex loss function in high-dimension($p\gg n$) setting; we give an algorithm which achieves the upper bound with less gradient complexity than previous ones. At last; we generalize the expected excess empirical risk from convex to Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition and give a tighter upper bound of the utility comparing with the result in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/ZhangZMW17}.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6865-differentially-private-empirical-risk-minimization-revisited-faster-and-more-general/bibtex,Di Wang; Minwei Ye; Jinhui Xu

Garber and Meshi (2016) designed a new decomposition-invariant pairwise FW variant with favorable dependency on the domain geometry. Unfortunately; it applies only to a restricted class of polytopes and cannot achieve theoretical and practical efficiency at the same time. In this paper; we show that by employing an away-step update; similar rates can be generalized to arbitrary polytopes with strong empirical performance. A new "condition number" of the domain is introduced which allows leveraging the sparsity of the solution. We applied the method to a reformulation of SVM; and the linear convergence rate depends; for the first time; on the number of support vectors.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6862-decomposition-invariant-conditional-gradient-for-general-polytopes-with-line-search/bibtex,Mohammad Ali Bashiri; Xinhua Zhang
2017,Dual Discriminator Generative Adversarial Nets,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6860-dual-discriminator-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6860-dual-discriminator-generative-adversarial-nets,We propose in this paper a novel approach to tackle the problem of mode collapse encountered in generative adversarial network (GAN). Our idea is intuitive but proven to be very effective; especially in addressing some key limitations of GAN. In essence; it combines the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and reverse KL divergences into a unified objective function; thus it exploits the complementary statistical properties from these divergences to effectively diversify the estimated density in capturing multi-modes. We term our method dual discriminator generative adversarial nets (D2GAN) which; unlike GAN; has two discriminators; and together with a generator; it also has the analogy of a minimax game; wherein a discriminator rewards high scores for samples from data distribution whilst another discriminator; conversely; favoring data from the generator; and the generator produces data to fool both two discriminators. We develop theoretical analysis to show that; given the maximal discriminators; optimizing the generator of D2GAN reduces to minimizing both KL and reverse KL divergences between data distribution and the distribution induced from the data generated by the generator; hence effectively avoiding the mode collapsing problem. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world large-scale datasets (MNIST; CIFAR-10; STL-10; ImageNet); where we have made our best effort to compare our D2GAN with the latest state-of-the-art GAN's variants in comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive and superior performance of our approach in generating good quality and diverse samples over baselines; and the capability of our method to scale up to ImageNet database.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6860-dual-discriminator-generative-adversarial-nets/bibtex,Tu Nguyen; Trung Le; Hung Vu; Dinh Phung
2017,Parallel Streaming Wasserstein Barycenters,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6858-parallel-streaming-wasserstein-barycenters.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6858-parallel-streaming-wasserstein-barycenters,Efficiently aggregating data from different sources is a challenging problem; particularly when samples from each source are distributed differently. These differences can be inherent to the inference task or present for other reasons: sensors in a sensor network may be placed far apart; affecting their individual measurements. Conversely; it is computationally advantageous to split Bayesian inference tasks across subsets of data; but data need not be identically distributed across subsets. One principled way to fuse probability distributions is via the lens of optimal transport: the Wasserstein barycenter is a single distribution that summarizes a collection of input measures while respecting their geometry. However; computing the barycenter scales poorly and requires discretization of all input distributions and the barycenter itself. Improving on this situation; we present a scalable; communication-efficient; parallel algorithm for computing the Wasserstein barycenter of arbitrary distributions. Our algorithm can operate directly on continuous input distributions and is optimized for streaming data. Our method is even robust to nonstationary input distributions and produces a barycenter estimate that tracks the input measures over time. The algorithm is semi-discrete; needing to discretize only the barycenter estimate. To the best of our knowledge; we also provide the first bounds on the quality of the approximate barycenter as the discretization becomes finer. Finally; we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method; both in tracking moving distributions on a sphere; as well as in a large-scale Bayesian inference task.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6858-parallel-streaming-wasserstein-barycenters/bibtex,Matthew Staib; Sebastian Claici; Justin M.

Given n points in a d-dimensional space where each coordinate is represented using B bits (i.e.; dB bits per point); it produces  a representation of size O( d log(d B/epsilon) +log n) bits per point from which one can approximate the distances up to a factor of 1 + epsilon. Our algorithm almost matches the recent bound of Indyk et al; 2017} while being much simpler. We compare our algorithm to Product Quantization (PQ) (Jegou et al; 2011) a state of the art heuristic metric compression method. We evaluate both algorithms on several data sets: SIFT; MNIST; New York City taxi time series and a synthetic one-dimensional data set embedded in a high-dimensional space. Our algorithm produces representations that are comparable to or better than those produced by PQ; while having provable guarantees on its performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6855-practical-data-dependent-metric-compression-with-provable-guarantees/bibtex,Piotr Indyk; Ilya Razenshteyn; Tal Wagner
2017,Nonlinear random matrix theory for deep learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6857-nonlinear-random-matrix-theory-for-deep-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6857-nonlinear-random-matrix-theory-for-deep-learning,Neural network configurations with random weights play an important role in the analysis of deep learning. They define the initial loss landscape and are closely related to kernel and random feature methods. Despite the fact that these networks are built out of random matrices; the vast and powerful machinery of random matrix theory has so far found limited success in studying them. A main obstacle in this direction is that neural networks are nonlinear; which prevents the straightforward utilization of many of the existing mathematical results. In this work; we open the door for direct applications of random matrix theory to deep learning by demonstrating that the pointwise nonlinearities typically applied in neural networks can be incorporated into a standard method of proof in random matrix theory known as the moments method. The test case for our study is the Gram matrix $Y^TY$; $Y=f(WX)$; where $W$ is a random weight matrix; $X$ is a random data matrix; and $f$ is a pointwise nonlinear activation function. We derive an explicit representation for the trace of the resolvent of this matrix; which defines its limiting spectral distribution. We apply these results to the computation of the asymptotic performance of single-layer random feature methods on a memorization task and to the analysis of the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix as it propagates through a neural network. As a byproduct of our analysis; we identify an intriguing new class of activation functions with favorable properties.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6857-nonlinear-random-matrix-theory-for-deep-learning/bibtex,Jeffrey Pennington; Pratik Worah

Generally; approaches have relied on control variates to reduce the variance of the REINFORCE estimator. Recent work \citep{jang2016categorical; maddison2016concrete} has taken a different approach; introducing a continuous relaxation of discrete variables to produce low-variance; but biased; gradient estimates. In this work; we combine the two approaches through a novel control variate that produces low-variance; \emph{unbiased} gradient estimates. Then; we introduce a modification to the continuous relaxation and show that the tightness of the relaxation can be adapted online; removing it as a hyperparameter. We show state-of-the-art variance reduction on several benchmark generative modeling tasks; generally leading to faster convergence to a better final log-likelihood.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6856-rebar-low-variance-unbiased-gradient-estimates-for-discrete-latent-variable-models/bibtex,George Tucker; Andriy Mnih; Chris J.

Our model makes use of a factorization mechanism for representing the regression coefficients of interactions among the predictors; while the interaction selection is guided by a prior distribution on random hypergraphs; a construction which generalizes the Finite Feature Model. We present a posterior inference algorithm based on Gibbs sampling; and establish posterior consistency of our regression model. Our method is evaluated with extensive experiments on simulated data and demonstrated to be able to identify meaningful interactions in applications in genetics and retail demand forecasting.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6853-multi-way-interacting-regression-via-factorization-machines/bibtex,Mikhail Yurochkin; XuanLong Nguyen; nikolaos Vasiloglou

Since a reaction may involve hundreds of atoms; fully exploring the space of possible transformations is intractable. The current solution utilizes reaction templates to limit the space; but it suffers from coverage and efficiency issues. In this paper; we propose a template-free approach to efficiently explore the space of product molecules by first pinpointing the reaction center -- the set of nodes and edges where graph edits occur. Since only a small number of atoms contribute to reaction center; we can directly enumerate candidate products.  The generated candidates are scored by a Weisfeiler-Lehman Difference Network that models high-order interactions between changes occurring at nodes across the molecule. Our framework outperforms the top-performing template-based approach with a 10% margin; while running orders of magnitude faster. Finally; we demonstrate that the model accuracy rivals the performance of domain experts.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6854-predicting-organic-reaction-outcomes-with-weisfeiler-lehman-network/bibtex,Wengong Jin; Connor Coley; Regina Barzilay; Tommi Jaakkola

We first present a natural notion of relatedness between WFAs by considering to which extent several WFAs can share a common underlying representation. We then introduce the model of vector-valued WFA which conveniently helps us formalize this notion of relatedness. Finally; we propose a spectral learning algorithm for vector-valued WFAs to tackle the multitask learning problem. By jointly learning multiple tasks in the form of a vector-valued WFA; our algorithm enforces the discovery of a representation space shared between tasks. The benefits of the proposed multitask approach are theoretically motivated and showcased through experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6852-multitask-spectral-learning-of-weighted-automata/bibtex,Guillaume Rabusseau; Borja Balle; Joelle Pineau
2017,EX2: Exploration with Exemplar Models for Deep Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6851-ex2-exploration-with-exemplar-models-for-deep-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6851-ex2-exploration-with-exemplar-models-for-deep-reinforcement-learning,Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to learn complex tasks using highly general policy classes. However; sparse reward problems remain a significant challenge. Exploration methods based on novelty detection have been particularly successful in such settings but typically require generative or predictive models of the observations; which can be difficult to train when the observations are very high-dimensional and complex; as in the case of raw images. We propose a novelty detection algorithm for exploration that is based entirely on discriminatively trained exemplar models; where classifiers are trained to discriminate each visited state against all others. Intuitively; novel states are easier to distinguish against other states seen during training. We show that this kind of discriminative modeling corresponds to implicit density estimation; and that it can be combined with count-based exploration to produce competitive results on a range of popular benchmark tasks; including state-of-the-art results on challenging egocentric observations in the vizDoom benchmark.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6851-ex2-exploration-with-exemplar-models-for-deep-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Justin Fu; John Co-Reyes; Sergey Levine
2017,Accuracy First: Selecting a Differential Privacy Level for Accuracy Constrained ERM,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6850-accuracy-first-selecting-a-differential-privacy-level-for-accuracy-constrained-erm.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6850-accuracy-first-selecting-a-differential-privacy-level-for-accuracy-constrained-erm,Traditional approaches to differential privacy assume a fixed privacy requirement ? for a computation; and attempt to maximize the accuracy of the computation subject to the privacy constraint. As differential privacy is increasingly deployed in practical settings; it may often be that there is instead a fixed accuracy requirement for a given computation and the data analyst would like to maximize the privacy of the computation subject to the accuracy constraint. This raises the question of how to find and run a maximally private empirical risk minimizer subject to a given accuracy requirement. We propose a general ?noise reduction? framework that can apply to a variety of private empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithms; using them to ?search? the space of privacy levels to find the empirically strongest one that meets the accuracy constraint; and incurring only logarithmic overhead in the number of privacy levels searched. The privacy analysis of our algorithm leads naturally to a version of differential privacy where the privacy parameters are dependent on the data; which we term ex-post privacy; and which is related to the recently introduced notion of privacy odometers. We also give an ex-post privacy analysis of the classical AboveThreshold privacy tool; modifying it to allow for queries chosen depending on the database. Finally; we apply our approach to two common objective functions; regularized linear and logistic regression; and empirically compare our noise reduction methods to (i) inverting the theoretical utility guarantees of standard private ERM algorithms and (ii) a stronger empirical baseline based on binary search.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6850-accuracy-first-selecting-a-differential-privacy-level-for-accuracy-constrained-erm/bibtex,Katrina Ligett; Seth Neel; Aaron Roth; Bo Waggoner; Steven Z.

2017,Rigorous Dynamics and Consistent Estimation in Arbitrarily Conditioned Linear Systems,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6848-rigorous-dynamics-and-consistent-estimation-in-arbitrarily-conditioned-linear-systems.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6848-rigorous-dynamics-and-consistent-estimation-in-arbitrarily-conditioned-linear-systems,The problem of estimating a random vector x from noisy linear measurements y=Ax+w with unknown parameters on the distributions of x and w; which must also be learned; arises in a wide range of statistical learning and linear inverse problems.  We show that a computationally simple iterative message-passing algorithm can provably obtain asymptotically consistent estimates in a certain high-dimensional large-system limit (LSL) under very general parameterizations.  Previous message passing techniques have required i.i.d. sub-Gaussian A matrices and often fail when the matrix is ill-conditioned. The proposed algorithm; called adaptive vector approximate message passing (Adaptive VAMP) with auto-tuning; applies to all right-rotationally random A.  Importantly; this class includes matrices with arbitrarily bad conditioning.  We show that the parameter estimates and mean squared error (MSE) of x in each iteration converge to deterministic limits that can be precisely predicted by a simple set of state evolution (SE) equations.  In addition; a simple testable condition is provided in which the MSE matches the Bayes-optimal value predicted by the replica method.  The paper thus provides a computationally simple method with provable guarantees of optimality and consistency over a large class of linear inverse problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6848-rigorous-dynamics-and-consistent-estimation-in-arbitrarily-conditioned-linear-systems/bibtex,Alyson K.

Specifically; we seek a factorization X\approx BC; where the k columns of B are a subset of those from X and C\in\Re_{\geq 0}^{k\times n}.  Equivalently; given the matrix X; consider the problem of finding a small subset; S; of the columns of X such that the conic hull of S \eps-approximates the conic hull of the columns of X; i.e.; the distance of every column of X to the conic hull of the columns of S should be at most an \eps-fraction of the angular diameter of X.   If k is the size of the smallest \eps-approximation; then we produce an O(k/\eps^{2/3}) sized O(\eps^{1/3})-approximation; yielding the first provable; polynomial time \eps-approximation for this class of NMF problems; where also desirably the approximation is independent of n and m. Furthermore; we prove an approximate conic Carath?odory theorem; a general sparsity result; that shows that any column of X can be \eps-approximated with an O(1/\eps^2) sparse combination from S.   Our results are facilitated by a reduction to the problem of approximating convex hulls;  and we prove that both the convex and conic hull variants are d-sum-hard; resolving an open problem.  Finally; we provide experimental results for the convex and conic algorithms on a variety of feature selection tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6847-sparse-approximate-conic-hulls/bibtex,Greg Van Buskirk; Benjamin Raichel; Nicholas Ruozzi
2017,Toward Goal-Driven Neural Network Models for the Rodent Whisker-Trigeminal System,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6849-toward-goal-driven-neural-network-models-for-the-rodent-whisker-trigeminal-system.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6849-toward-goal-driven-neural-network-models-for-the-rodent-whisker-trigeminal-system,In large part; rodents ?see? the world through their whiskers; a powerful tactile sense enabled by a series of brain areas that form the whisker-trigeminal system. Raw sensory data arrives in the form of mechanical input to the exquisitely sensitive; actively-controllable whisker array; and is processed through a sequence of neural circuits; eventually arriving in cortical regions that communicate with decision making and memory areas. Although a long history of experimental studies has characterized many aspects of these processing stages; the computational operations of the whisker-trigeminal system remain largely unknown. In the present work; we take a goal-driven deep neural network (DNN) approach to modeling these computations. First; we construct a biophysically-realistic model of the rat whisker array. We then generate a large dataset of whisker sweeps across a wide variety of 3D objects in highly-varying poses; angles; and speeds. Next; we train DNNs from several distinct architectural families to solve a shape recognition task in this dataset. Each architectural family represents a structurally-distinct hypothesis for processing in the whisker-trigeminal system; corresponding to different ways in which spatial and temporal information can be integrated. We find that most networks perform poorly on the challenging shape recognition task; but that specific architectures from several families can achieve reasonable performance levels. Finally; we show that Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs); a tool for comparing population codes between neural systems; can separate these higher performing networks with data of a type that could plausibly be collected in a neurophysiological or imaging experiment. Our results are a proof-of-concept that DNN models of the whisker-trigeminal system are potentially within reach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6849-toward-goal-driven-neural-network-models-for-the-rodent-whisker-trigeminal-system/bibtex,Chengxu Zhuang; Jonas Kubilius; Mitra JZ Hartmann; Daniel L.

2017,Fisher GAN,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6845-fisher-gan.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6845-fisher-gan,Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful models for learning complex distributions. Stable training of GANs has been addressed in many recent works which explore different metrics between distributions. In this paper we introduce Fisher GAN that fits within the Integral Probability Metrics (IPM) framework for  training GANs. Fisher GAN defines a data dependent constraint on the second order moments of the critic. We show in this paper that Fisher GAN allows for stable and time efficient  training that does not compromise the capacity of the critic; and does not need data independent constraints such as weight clipping. We analyze our Fisher IPM theoretically and provide an algorithm based on Augmented Lagrangian for Fisher GAN. We validate our claims on both image sample generation and semi-supervised classification using Fisher GAN.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6845-fisher-gan/bibtex,Youssef Mroueh; Tom Sercu

In recent years; there is a growing interest in the study of such networks; in part due to the successes of deep learning.  The main question of this body of research (and also of our paper) is related to the existence and optimality properties of the critical points of the mean-squared loss function.  An additional primary concern of our paper pertains to the robustness of these critical points in the face of (a small amount of) regularization.  An optimal control model is introduced for this purpose and a learning algorithm (backprop with weight decay) derived for the same using the Hamilton's formulation of optimal control.  The formulation is used to provide a complete characterization of the critical points in terms of the solutions of a nonlinear matrix-valued equation; referred to as the characteristic equation.  Analytical and numerical tools from bifurcation theory are used to compute the critical points via the solutions of the characteristic equation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6844-how-regularization-affects-the-critical-points-in-linear-networks/bibtex,Amirhossein Taghvaei; Jin W.

Given an order-$K$ tensor $X\in\mathbb{R}^{N_1\times\cdots\times N_K}$; our algorithm randomly samples a constant number $s$ of indices for each mode and creates a ``mini'' tensor $\tilde{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{s\times\cdots\times s}$; whose elements are given by the intersection of the sampled indices on $X$.  Then; we show that the residual error of the Tucker decomposition of $\tilde{X}$ is sufficiently close to that of $X$ with high probability.  This result implies that we can figure out how much we can fit a low-rank tensor to $X$ \emph{in constant time}; regardless of the size of $X$. This is useful for guessing the favorable rank of Tucker decomposition.  Finally; we demonstrate how the sampling method works quickly and accurately using multiple real datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6841-fitting-low-rank-tensors-in-constant-time/bibtex,Kohei Hayashi; Yuichi Yoshida

Off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) algorithms use historical data collected from running a previous policy to evaluate a new policy; which provides a means for evaluating a policy without requiring it to ever be deployed. Importance sampling is a popular OPE method because it is robust to partial observability and works with continuous states and actions. However; the amount of historical data required by importance sampling can scale exponentially with the horizon of the problem: the number of sequential decisions that are made. We propose using policies over temporally extended actions; called options; and show that combining these policies with importance sampling can significantly improve performance for long-horizon problems. In addition; we can take advantage of special cases that arise due to options-based policies to further improve the performance of importance sampling. We further generalize these special cases to a general covariance testing rule that can be used to decide which weights to drop in an IS estimate; and derive a new IS algorithm called Incremental Importance Sampling that can provide significantly more accurate estimates for a broad class of domains.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6843-using-options-and-covariance-testing-for-long-horizon-off-policy-policy-evaluation/bibtex,Zhaohan Guo; Philip S.

Compared with standard approaches; such as bandwidth selection; we show how metric learning can significantly reduce the mean square error (MSE) in kernel regression; particularly for high-dimensional data.  We propose a method for efficiently learning a good metric function based upon analyzing the performance of the NW estimator for Gaussian-distributed data.  A key feature of our approach is that the NW estimator with a learned metric uses information from both the global and local structure of the training data.  Theoretical and empirical results confirm that the learned metric can considerably reduce the bias and MSE for kernel regression even when the data are not confined to Gaussian.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6839-generative-local-metric-learning-for-kernel-regression/bibtex,Yung-Kyun Noh; Masashi Sugiyama; Kee-Eung Kim; Frank Park; Daniel D.

Benefiting from recent advances in deep learning; deep hashing methods have achieved promising results for image retrieval. However; there are some limitations of previous deep hashing methods (e.g.; the semantic information is not fully exploited). In this paper; we develop a deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm based on the assumption that the learned binary codes should be ideal for classification. Both the pairwise label information and the classification information are used to learn the hash codes within one stream framework. We constrain the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly; which is rarely investigated in deep hashing algorithm. Because of the discrete nature of hash codes; an alternating minimization method is used to optimize the objective function.

The demand for items is a combined effect of form utility and time utility; i.e.; a product must both be intrinsically appealing to a consumer and the time must be right for purchase. In particular for durable goods; time utility is a function of inter-purchase duration within product category because consumers are unlikely to purchase two items in the same category in close temporal succession. Moreover; purchase data; in contrast to rating data; is implicit with non-purchases not necessarily indicating dislike. Together; these issues give rise to the positive-unlabeled demand-aware recommendation problem that we pose via joint low-rank tensor completion and product category inter-purchase duration vector estimation. We further relax this problem and propose a highly scalable alternating minimization approach with which we can solve problems with millions of users and millions of items in a single thread. We also show superior prediction accuracies on multiple real-world datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6835-scalable-demand-aware-recommendation/bibtex,Jinfeng Yi; Cho-Jui Hsieh; Kush R.

The result holds for log-depth networks from a rich family of architectures. To the best of our knowledge; it is the first polynomial-time guarantee for the standard neural network learning algorithm for networks of depth more that two.  As corollaries; it follows that for neural networks of any depth between 2 and log(n); SGD is guaranteed to learn; in polynomial time; constant degree polynomials with polynomially bounded coefficients. Likewise; it follows  that SGD on large enough networks can learn any continuous function (not in polynomial time); complementing classical expressivity results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6836-sgd-learns-the-conjugate-kernel-class-of-the-network/bibtex,Amit Daniely

At each iteration; TrustVI proposes and assesses a step based on minibatches of draws from the variational distribution. The algorithm provably converges to a stationary point. We implemented TrustVI in the Stan framework and compared it to two alternatives: Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) and Hessian-free Stochastic Gradient Variational Inference (HFSGVI). The former is based on stochastic first-order optimization. The latter uses second-order information; but lacks convergence guarantees. TrustVI typically converged at least one order of magnitude faster than ADVI; demonstrating the value of stochastic second-order information. TrustVI often found substantially better variational distributions than HFSGVI; demonstrating that our convergence theory can matter in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6834-fast-black-box-variational-inference-through-stochastic-trust-region-optimization/bibtex,Jeffrey Regier; Michael I.

2017,Collaborative PAC Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6833-collaborative-pac-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6833-collaborative-pac-learning,We introduce a collaborative PAC learning model; in which k players attempt to learn the same underlying concept. We ask how much more information is required to learn an accurate classifier for all players simultaneously. We refer to the ratio between the sample complexity of collaborative PAC learning and its non-collaborative (single-player) counterpart as the overhead. We design learning algorithms with O(ln(k)) and O(ln^2(k)) overhead in the personalized and centralized variants our model. This gives an exponential improvement upon the naive algorithm that does not share information among players. We complement our upper bounds with an Omega(ln(k)) overhead lower bound; showing that our results are tight up to a logarithmic factor.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6833-collaborative-pac-learning/bibtex,Avrim Blum; Nika Haghtalab; Ariel D.

2017,Analyzing Hidden Representations in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition Systems,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6838-analyzing-hidden-representations-in-end-to-end-automatic-speech-recognition-systems.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6838-analyzing-hidden-representations-in-end-to-end-automatic-speech-recognition-systems,Neural networks have become ubiquitous in automatic speech recognition systems. While neural networks are typically used as acoustic models in more complex systems; recent studies have explored end-to-end speech recognition systems based on neural networks; which can be trained to directly predict text from input acoustic features. Although such systems are conceptually elegant and simpler than traditional systems; it is less obvious how to interpret the trained models. In this work; we analyze the speech representations learned by a deep end-to-end model that is based on convolutional and recurrent layers; and trained with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. We use a pre-trained model to generate frame-level features which are given to a classifier that is trained on frame classification into phones. We evaluate representations from different layers of the deep model and compare their quality for predicting phone labels. Our experiments shed light on important aspects of the end-to-end model such as layer depth; model complexity; and other design choices.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6838-analyzing-hidden-representations-in-end-to-end-automatic-speech-recognition-systems/bibtex,Yonatan Belinkov; James Glass
2017,Noise-Tolerant Interactive Learning Using Pairwise Comparisons,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6837-noise-tolerant-interactive-learning-using-pairwise-comparisons.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6837-noise-tolerant-interactive-learning-using-pairwise-comparisons,We study the problem of interactively learning a binary classifier using noisy labeling and pairwise comparison oracles; where the comparison oracle answers which one in the given two instances is more likely to be positive. Learning from such oracles has multiple applications where obtaining direct labels is harder but pairwise comparisons are easier; and the algorithm can leverage both types of oracles. In this paper; we attempt to characterize how the access to an easier comparison oracle helps in improving the label and total query complexity. We show that the comparison oracle reduces the learning problem to that of learning a threshold function. We then present an algorithm that interactively queries the label and comparison oracles and we characterize its query complexity under Tsybakov and adversarial noise conditions for the comparison and labeling oracles. Our lower bounds show that our label and total query complexity is almost optimal.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6837-noise-tolerant-interactive-learning-using-pairwise-comparisons/bibtex,Yichong Xu; Hongyang Zhang; Kyle Miller; Aarti Singh; Artur Dubrawski

Over the years; many mathematical; statistical and algorithmic problems on them have been studied. Until recently; the only known algorithms for provably learning them relied on exhaustive search; correlation decay or various incoherence assumptions. Bresler gave an algorithm for learning general Ising models on bounded degree graphs. His approach was based on a structural result about mutual information in Ising models.   Here we take a more conceptual approach to proving lower bounds on the mutual information. Our proof generalizes well beyond Ising models; to arbitrary Markov random fields with higher order interactions. As an application; we obtain algorithms for learning Markov random fields on bounded degree graphs on $n$ nodes with $r$-order interactions in $n^r$ time and $\log n$ sample complexity. Our algorithms also extend to various partial observation models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6840-information-theoretic-properties-of-markov-random-fields-and-their-algorithmic-applications/bibtex,Linus Hamilton; Frederic Koehler; Ankur Moitra
2017,OnACID: Online Analysis of Calcium Imaging Data in Real Time,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6832-onacid-online-analysis-of-calcium-imaging-data-in-real-time.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6832-onacid-online-analysis-of-calcium-imaging-data-in-real-time,Optical imaging methods using calcium indicators are critical for monitoring the activity of large neuronal populations in vivo. Imaging experiments typically generate a large amount of data that needs to be processed to extract the activity of the imaged neuronal sources. While deriving such processing algorithms is an active area of research; most existing methods require the processing of large amounts of data at a time; rendering them vulnerable to the volume of the recorded data; and preventing real-time experimental interrogation. Here we introduce OnACID; an Online framework for the Analysis of streaming Calcium Imaging Data; including i) motion artifact correction; ii) neuronal source extraction; and iii) activity denoising and deconvolution. Our approach combines and extends previous work on online dictionary learning and calcium imaging data analysis; to deliver an automated pipeline that can discover and track the activity of hundreds of cells in real time; thereby enabling new types of closed-loop experiments. We apply our algorithm on two large scale experimental datasets; benchmark its performance on manually annotated data; and show that it outperforms a popular offline approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6832-onacid-online-analysis-of-calcium-imaging-data-in-real-time/bibtex,Andrea Giovannucci; Johannes Friedrich; Matt Kaufman; Anne Churchland; Dmitri Chklovskii; Liam Paninski; Eftychios A.

2017,An inner-loop free solution to inverse problems using deep neural networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6831-an-inner-loop-free-solution-to-inverse-problems-using-deep-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6831-an-inner-loop-free-solution-to-inverse-problems-using-deep-neural-networks,We propose a new method that uses deep learning techniques to accelerate the popular alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) solution for inverse problems. The ADMM updates consist of a proximity operator; a least squares regression that includes a big matrix inversion; and an explicit solution for updating the dual variables. Typically; inner loops are required to solve the first two sub-minimization problems due to the intractability of the prior and the matrix inversion.  To avoid such drawbacks or limitations; we propose an inner-loop free update rule with two pre-trained deep convolutional architectures. More specifically; we learn a conditional denoising auto-encoder which imposes an implicit data-dependent prior/regularization on ground-truth in the first sub-minimization problem. This design follows an empirical Bayesian strategy; leading to so-called amortized inference. For matrix inversion in the second sub-problem; we learn a convolutional neural network to approximate the matrix inversion; i.e.; the inverse mapping is learned by feeding the input through the learned forward network. Note that training this neural network does not require ground-truth or measurements; i.e.; data-independent. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method compared with the conventional ADMM solution using inner loops for solving inverse problems.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6831-an-inner-loop-free-solution-to-inverse-problems-using-deep-neural-networks/bibtex,Kai Fan; Qi Wei; Lawrence Carin; Katherine A.

The conditional independence structure of an arbitrary distribution can be represented as an undirected graph (or Markov random field); but most algorithms for learning this structure are restricted to the discrete or Gaussian cases. Our new approach allows for more realistic and accurate descriptions of the distribution in question; and in turn better estimates of its sparse Markov structure. Sparsity in the graph is of interest as it can accelerate inference; improve sampling methods; and reveal important dependencies between variables. The algorithm relies on exploiting the connection between the sparsity of the graph and the sparsity of transport maps; which deterministically couple one probability measure to another.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6830-beyond-normality-learning-sparse-probabilistic-graphical-models-in-the-non-gaussian-setting/bibtex,Rebecca Morrison; Ricardo Baptista; Youssef Marzouk

Only assuming the smoothness of each component; the complexity of SCSG to reach a stationary point with $E \|\nabla f(x)\|^{2}\le \epsilon$ is $O(\min\{\epsilon^{-5/3}; \epsilon^{-1}n^{2/3}\})$; which strictly outperforms the stochastic gradient descent. Moreover; SCSG is never worse than the state-of-the-art methods based on variance reduction and it significantly outperforms them when the target accuracy is low. A similar acceleration is also achieved when the functions satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Empirical experiments demonstrate that SCSG outperforms stochastic gradient methods on training multi-layers neural networks in terms of both training and validation loss.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6829-non-convex-finite-sum-optimization-via-scsg-methods/bibtex,Lihua Lei; Cheng Ju; Jianbo Chen; Michael I.

Such problems occur naturally in many scientific and web applications. Although there are efficient methods which tackle this problem; they are mostly not scalable. In this paper; we develop a method that transforms the quadratic constraint into a linear form by a sampling a set of low-discrepancy points. The transformed problem can then be solved by applying any state-of-the-art large-scale solvers. We show the convergence of our approximate solution to the true solution as well as some finite sample error bounds. Experimental results are also shown to prove scalability in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6824-large-scale-quadratically-constrained-quadratic-program-via-low-discrepancy-sequences/bibtex,Kinjal Basu; Ankan Saha; Shaunak Chatterjee

A number of computer vision problems can be framed in this manner including multi-person pose estimation; instance segmentation; and multi-object tracking. Usually the grouping of detections is achieved with multi-stage pipelines; instead we propose an approach that teaches a network to simultaneously output detections and group assignments. This technique can be easily integrated into any state-of-the-art network architecture that  produces pixel-wise predictions. We show how to apply this method to  multi-person pose estimation and report state-of-the-art performance  on the MPII and MS-COCO datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6822-associative-embedding-end-to-end-learning-for-joint-detection-and-grouping/bibtex,Alejandro Newell; Zhiao Huang; Jia Deng

We propose an information retrieval-inspired approach for this problem that is motivated by the increased importance of maximally leveraging all the available information in this low-data regime. We define a training objective that aims to extract as much information as possible from each training batch by effectively optimizing over all relative orderings of the batch points simultaneously. In particular; we view each batch point as a `query' that ranks the remaining ones based on its predicted relevance to them and we define a model within the framework of structured prediction to optimize mean Average Precision over these rankings. Our method achieves impressive results on the standard few-shot classification benchmarks while is also capable of few-shot retrieval.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6820-few-shot-learning-through-an-information-retrieval-lens/bibtex,Eleni Triantafillou; Richard Zemel; Raquel Urtasun
2017,Deep Multi-task Gaussian Processes for Survival Analysis with Competing Risks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6827-deep-multi-task-gaussian-processes-for-survival-analysis-with-competing-risks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6827-deep-multi-task-gaussian-processes-for-survival-analysis-with-competing-risks,Designing optimal treatment plans for patients with comorbidities requires accurate cause-specific mortality prognosis. Motivated by the recent availability of linked electronic health records; we develop a nonparametric Bayesian model for survival analysis with competing risks; which can be used for jointly assessing a patient's risk of multiple (competing) adverse outcomes. The model views a patient's survival times with respect to the competing risks as the outputs of a deep multi-task Gaussian process (DMGP); the inputs to which are the patients' covariates. Unlike parametric survival analysis methods based on Cox and Weibull models; our model uses DMGPs to capture complex non-linear interactions between the patients' covariates and cause-specific survival times; thereby learning flexible patient-specific and cause-specific survival curves; all in a data-driven fashion without explicit parametric assumptions on the hazard rates. We propose a variational inference algorithm that is capable of learning the model parameters from time-to-event data while handling right censoring. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art survival models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6827-deep-multi-task-gaussian-processes-for-survival-analysis-with-competing-risks/bibtex,

The exponential family has recently been extended to the t-exponential family; which contains Student-t distributions as family members and thus allows us to handle noisy data well. However; since the t-exponential family is defined by the deformed exponential; an efficient learning algorithm for the t-exponential family such as expectation propagation (EP) cannot be derived in the same way as the ordinary exponential family. In this paper; we borrow the mathematical tools of q-algebra from statistical physics and show that the pseudo additivity of distributions allows us to perform calculation of t-exponential family distributions through natural parameters. We then develop an expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for the t-exponential family; which provides a deterministic approximation to the posterior or predictive distribution with simple moment matching. We finally apply the proposed EP algorithm to the Bayes point machine and Student-t process classification; and demonstrate their performance numerically.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6819-expectation-propagation-for-t-exponential-family-using-q-algebra/bibtex,Futoshi Futami; Issei Sato; Masashi Sugiyama

We describe an approach for increasing the flexibility of an autoregressive model; based on modelling the random numbers that the model uses internally when generating data. By constructing a stack of autoregressive models; each modelling the random numbers of the next model in the stack; we obtain a type of normalizing flow suitable for density estimation; which we call Masked Autoregressive Flow. This type of flow is closely related to Inverse Autoregressive Flow and is a generalization of Real NVP.

In both algorithms; server running time is $\tilde O(n)$ and user running time is $\tilde O(1)$; hence improving on the prior state-of-the-art result of Bassily and Smith [STOC 2015] requiring $\tilde O(n^{5/2})$ server time and $\tilde O(n^{3/2})$ user time. With a typically large number of participants in local algorithms ($n$ in the millions); this reduction in time complexity; in particular at the user side; is crucial for the use of such algorithms in practice. We implemented Algorithm TreeHist to verify our theoretical analysis and compared its performance with the performance of Google's RAPPOR code.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6823-practical-locally-private-heavy-hitters/bibtex,Raef Bassily; kobbi nissim; Uri Stemmer; Abhradeep Guha Thakurta
2017,Inhomogeneous Hypergraph Clustering with Applications,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6825-inhomogeneous-hypergraph-clustering-with-applications.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6825-inhomogeneous-hypergraph-clustering-with-applications,Hypergraph partitioning is an important problem in machine learning; computer vision and network analytics. A widely used method for hypergraph partitioning relies on minimizing a normalized sum of the costs of partitioning hyperedges across clusters. Algorithmic solutions based on this approach assume that different partitions of a hyperedge incur the same cost. However; this assumption fails to leverage the fact that different subsets of vertices within the same hyperedge may have different structural importance. We hence propose a new hypergraph clustering technique; termed inhomogeneous hypergraph partitioning; which assigns different costs to different hyperedge cuts. We prove that inhomogeneous partitioning produces a quadratic approximation to the optimal solution if the inhomogeneous costs satisfy submodularity constraints. Moreover; we demonstrate that inhomogenous partitioning offers significant performance improvements in applications such as structure learning of rankings; subspace segmentation and motif clustering.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6825-inhomogeneous-hypergraph-clustering-with-applications/bibtex,Pan Li; Olgica Milenkovic

This learning problem is difficult because it requires learning the parameters in a continuous space as well as the structure in a discrete space. We propose a framework; Neural Logic Programming; that combines the parameter and structure learning of first-order logical rules in an end-to-end differentiable model. This approach is inspired by a recently-developed differentiable logic called TensorLog [5]; where inference tasks can be compiled into sequences of differentiable operations. We design a neural controller system that learns to compose these operations. Empirically; our method outperforms prior work on multiple knowledge base benchmark datasets; including Freebase and WikiMovies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6826-differentiable-learning-of-logical-rules-for-knowledge-base-reasoning/bibtex,Fan Yang; Zhilin Yang; William W.

This raises concerns that such classifiers are vulnerable to attacks and calls into question their usage in safety-critical systems. We show in this paper for the first time formal guarantees on the robustness of a classifier by giving instance-specific \emph{lower bounds} on the norm of the input manipulation required to change the classifier decision. Based on this analysis we propose the Cross-Lipschitz regularization functional. We show that using this form of regularization in kernel methods resp. neural networks improves the robustness of the classifier without any loss in prediction performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6821-formal-guarantees-on-the-robustness-of-a-classifier-against-adversarial-manipulation/bibtex,Matthias Hein; Maksym Andriushchenko

This framework allows us to study a very general class of problems; with applications in statistics; machine learning; and other fields. To solve this problem; we analyze the Upper-Confidence Frank-Wolfe algorithm; inspired by techniques for bandits and convex optimization.

It is a matrix-gain algorithm designed so that its asymptotic variance is optimal. Moreover; an ODE analysis suggests that the transient behavior is a close match to a deterministic Newton-Raphson implementation. This is made possible by a  two time-scale update equation for the matrix gain sequence. The analysis suggests that the approach will lead to stable and efficient computation even for non-ideal parameterized settings. Numerical experiments confirm the quick convergence; even in such non-ideal cases.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6818-zap-q-learning/bibtex,Adithya M Devraj; Sean Meyn

However; memory consumption becomes a bottleneck as one needs to store all the intermediate activations for calculating gradients using backpropagation. In this work; we present the Reversible Residual Network (RevNet); a variant of ResNets where each layer's activations can be reconstructed exactly from the next layer's. Therefore; the activations for most layers need not be stored in memory during backprop. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RevNets on CIFAR and ImageNet; establishing nearly identical performance to equally-sized ResNets; with activation storage requirements independent of depth.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6816-the-reversible-residual-network-backpropagation-without-storing-activations/bibtex,Aidan N.

2017,Eigenvalue Decay Implies Polynomial-Time Learnability for Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6814-eigenvalue-decay-implies-polynomial-time-learnability-for-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6814-eigenvalue-decay-implies-polynomial-time-learnability-for-neural-networks,We consider the problem of learning function classes computed by   neural networks with various activations (e.g. ReLU or Sigmoid); a   task believed to be computationally intractable in the worst-case.   A major open problem is to understand the minimal assumptions under   which these classes admit provably efficient algorithms. In this work we show   that a natural distributional assumption corresponding to {\em     eigenvalue decay} of the Gram matrix yields polynomial-time   algorithms in the non-realizable setting for expressive classes of   networks (e.g. feed-forward networks of ReLUs).  We make no    assumptions on the structure of the network or the labels.  Given   sufficiently-strong eigenvalue decay; we obtain {\em     fully}-polynomial time algorithms in {\em all} the relevant   parameters with respect to square-loss.  This is the first purely   distributional assumption that leads to polynomial-time algorithms   for networks of ReLUs.  Further; unlike   prior distributional assumptions (e.g.; the marginal distribution is   Gaussian); eigenvalue decay has been observed in practice on common   data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6814-eigenvalue-decay-implies-polynomial-time-learnability-for-neural-networks/bibtex,Surbhi Goel; Adam Klivans
2017,MMD GAN: Towards Deeper Understanding of Moment Matching Network,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6815-mmd-gan-towards-deeper-understanding-of-moment-matching-network.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6815-mmd-gan-towards-deeper-understanding-of-moment-matching-network,Generative moment matching network (GMMN) is a deep generative model that differs from Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by replacing the discriminator in GAN with a two-sample test based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Although some theoretical guarantees of MMD have been studied; the empirical performance of GMMN is still not as competitive as that of GAN on challenging and large benchmark datasets. The computational efficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN; partially due to its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training. In this paper; we propose to improve both the model expressiveness of GMMN and its computational efficiency by introducing {\it adversarial kernel learning} techniques; as the replacement of a fixed Gaussian kernel in the original GMMN. The new approach combines the key ideas in both GMMN and GAN; hence we name it MMD-GAN. The new distance measure in MMD-GAN is a meaningful loss that enjoys the advantage of weak$^*$ topology and can be optimized via gradient descent with relatively small batch sizes. In our evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets; including MNIST; CIFAR-10; CelebA and LSUN; the performance of MMD-GAN significantly outperforms GMMN; and is competitive with other representative GAN works.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6815-mmd-gan-towards-deeper-understanding-of-moment-matching-network/bibtex,Chun-Liang Li; Wei-Cheng Chang; Yu Cheng; Yiming Yang; Barnabas Poczos

Not only can graphs represent details about individual objects in a scene but they can capture the interactions between pairs of objects. We present a method for training a convolutional neural network such that it takes in an input image and produces a full graph definition. This is done end-to-end in a single stage with the use of associative embeddings. The network learns to simultaneously identify all of the elements that make up a graph and piece them together. We benchmark on the Visual Genome dataset; and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the challenging task of scene graph generation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6812-pixels-to-graphs-by-associative-embedding/bibtex,Alejandro Newell; Jia Deng
2017,Training Deep Networks without Learning Rates Through Coin Betting,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6811-training-deep-networks-without-learning-rates-through-coin-betting.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6811-training-deep-networks-without-learning-rates-through-coin-betting,Deep learning methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in many application scenarios.  Yet; these methods require a significant amount of hyperparameters tuning in order to achieve  the best results. In particular; tuning the learning rates in the stochastic optimization  process is still one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper; we propose a new stochastic gradient descent procedure for deep networks that  does not require any learning rate setting. Contrary to previous methods; we do not adapt the  learning rates nor we make use of the assumed curvature of the objective function. Instead;  we reduce the optimization process to a game of betting on a coin and propose a learning rate free optimal algorithm for this scenario. Theoretical convergence is proven for convex and quasi-convex functions and empirical evidence shows  the advantage of our algorithm over popular stochastic gradient algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6811-training-deep-networks-without-learning-rates-through-coin-betting/bibtex,Francesco Orabona; Tatiana Tommasi
2017,Runtime Neural Pruning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6813-runtime-neural-pruning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6813-runtime-neural-pruning,In this paper; we propose a Runtime Neural Pruning (RNP) framework which prunes the deep neural network dynamically at the runtime. Unlike existing neural pruning methods which produce a fixed pruned model for deployment; our method preserves the full ability of the original network and conducts pruning according to the input image and current feature maps adaptively. The pruning is performed in a bottom-up; layer-by-layer manner; which we model as a Markov decision process and use reinforcement learning for training. The agent judges the importance of each convolutional kernel and conducts channel-wise pruning conditioned on different samples; where the network is pruned more when the image is easier for the task. Since the ability of network is fully preserved; the balance point is easily adjustable according to the available resources. Our method can be applied to off-the-shelf network structures and reach a better tradeoff between speed and accuracy; especially with a large pruning rate.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6813-runtime-neural-pruning/bibtex,Ji Lin; Yongming Rao; Jiwen Lu; Jie Zhou

We study a setting where two agents engage in playing a referential game and; from scratch; develop a communication protocol necessary to succeed in this game. Unlike previous work; we require that messages they exchange; both at train and test time; are in the form of a language (i.e. sequences of discrete symbols). We compare a reinforcement learning approach and one using a differentiable relaxation (straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimator) and observe that the latter is much faster to converge and it results in more effective protocols. Interestingly; we also observe that the protocol we induce by optimizing the communication success  exhibits a degree of compositionality and variability (i.e. the same information can be phrased in different ways); both properties characteristic of natural languages.    As the ultimate goal is to ensure that communication is accomplished in natural language; we also perform experiments where we inject prior information about natural language into our model  and study properties of the resulting protocol.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6810-emergence-of-language-with-multi-agent-games-learning-to-communicate-with-sequences-of-symbols/bibtex,Serhii Havrylov; Ivan Titov

Specifically; we introduce models based on elementary symmetric polynomials; these polynomials capture "partial volumes" and offer a graded interpolation between the widely used A-optimal and D-optimal design models; obtaining each of them as special cases. We analyze properties of our models; and derive both greedy and convex-relaxation algorithms for computing the associated designs. Our analysis establishes approximation guarantees on these algorithms; while our empirical results substantiate our claims and demonstrate a curious phenomenon concerning our greedy algorithm. Finally; as a byproduct; we obtain new results on the theory of elementary symmetric polynomials that may be of independent interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6809-elementary-symmetric-polynomials-for-optimal-experimental-design/bibtex,Zelda E.

In this setting; arms may not be comparable; and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms.  We propose an algorithm; UnchainedBandits; that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms; or Pareto front; of any poset  even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be a priori distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms;   with a set of minimal assumptions. This means that UnchainedBandits does not require information about comparability and can be used with limited knowledge of the poset. To achieve this; the algorithm relies on the concept of decoys; which stems from social psychology.   We also provide theoretical guarantees on both the regret incurred and the number of comparison required by UnchainedBandits; and we report   compelling empirical results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6808-bandits-dueling-on-partially-ordered-sets/bibtex,Julien Audiffren; Liva Ralaivola
2017,Consistent Robust Regression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6806-consistent-robust-regression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6806-consistent-robust-regression,We present the first efficient and provably consistent estimator for the robust regression problem. The area of robust learning and optimization has generated a significant amount of interest in the learning and statistics communities in recent years owing to its applicability in scenarios with corrupted data; as well as in handling model mis-specifications. In particular; special interest has been devoted to the fundamental problem of robust linear regression where estimators that can tolerate corruption in up to a constant fraction of the response variables are widely studied. Surprisingly however; to this date; we are not aware of a polynomial time estimator that offers a consistent estimate in the presence of dense; unbounded corruptions. In this work we present such an estimator; called CRR. This solves an open problem put forward in the work of (Bhatia et al; 2015). Our consistency analysis requires a novel two-stage proof technique involving a careful analysis of the stability of ordered lists which may be of independent interest. We show that CRR not only offers consistent estimates; but is empirically far superior to several other recently proposed algorithms for the robust regression problem; including extended Lasso and the TORRENT algorithm. In comparison; CRR offers comparable or better model recovery but with runtimes that are faster by an order of magnitude.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6806-consistent-robust-regression/bibtex,Kush Bhatia; Prateek Jain; Parameswaran Kamalaruban; Purushottam Kar
2017,Natural Value Approximators: Learning when to Trust Past Estimates,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6807-natural-value-approximators-learning-when-to-trust-past-estimates.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6807-natural-value-approximators-learning-when-to-trust-past-estimates,Neural networks have a smooth initial inductive bias; such that small changes in input do not lead to large changes in output. However; in reinforcement learning domains with sparse rewards; value functions have non-smooth structure with a characteristic asymmetric discontinuity whenever rewards arrive. We propose a mechanism that learns an interpolation between a direct value estimate and a projected value estimate computed from the encountered reward and the previous estimate. This reduces the need to learn about discontinuities; and thus improves the value function approximation. Furthermore; as the interpolation is learned and state-dependent; our method can deal with heterogeneous observability. We demonstrate that this one change leads to significant improvements on multiple Atari games; when applied to the state-of-the-art A3C algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6807-natural-value-approximators-learning-when-to-trust-past-estimates/bibtex,Zhongwen Xu; Joseph Modayil; Hado P. van Hasselt; Andre Barreto; David Silver; Tom Schaul
2017,Bayesian Dyadic Trees and Histograms for  Regression,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6804-bayesian-dyadic-trees-and-histograms-for-regression.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6804-bayesian-dyadic-trees-and-histograms-for-regression,Many machine learning  tools for regression are based on recursive partitioning of the covariate space into smaller regions; where the regression function can be estimated locally. Among these; regression trees and their ensembles have demonstrated impressive empirical performance.    In this work;  we shed light on the machinery behind Bayesian variants of these methods.  In particular; we study Bayesian regression histograms; such as Bayesian dyadic trees; in the simple regression case with just one predictor.   We focus on the reconstruction of regression surfaces that are piecewise constant; where the number of jumps is unknown. We show that with suitably designed priors; posterior distributions concentrate around the true step regression function at a near-minimax rate. These results {\sl do not} require the knowledge of the true number of steps; nor the width of the true partitioning cells. Thus; Bayesian dyadic regression trees are fully adaptive and can recover the true piecewise regression function nearly as well as if we knew the exact number and location  of jumps. Our results constitute the first step towards  understanding why Bayesian trees and their ensembles have worked so well in practice.  As an aside; we discuss prior distributions  on balanced interval partitions and how they relate to an old  problem in geometric probability. Namely; we relate the probability of covering the circumference of a circle with random arcs whose endpoints are confined to a grid; a new variant of the original problem.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6804-bayesian-dyadic-trees-and-histograms-for-regression/bibtex,St?phanie van der Pas; Veronika Rockova

Commonly; steganography is used to unobtrusively hide a small message within the noisy regions of a larger image.  In this study; we attempt to place a full size color image within another image of the same size.  Deep neural networks are simultaneously trained to create the hiding and revealing processes and are designed to specifically work as a pair.  The system is trained on images drawn randomly from the ImageNet database; and works well on natural images from a wide variety of sources.  Beyond demonstrating the successful application of deep learning to hiding images; we carefully examine how the result is achieved and explore extensions.  Unlike many popular steganographic methods that encode the secret message within the least significant bits of the carrier image; our approach compresses and distributes the secret image's representation across all of the available bits.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6802-hiding-images-in-plain-sight-deep-steganography/bibtex,Shumeet Baluja
2017,Compatible Reward Inverse Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6800-compatible-reward-inverse-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6800-compatible-reward-inverse-reinforcement-learning,Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is an effective approach to recover a reward function that explains the behavior of an expert by observing a set of demonstrations.  This paper is about a novel model-free IRL approach that; differently from most of the existing IRL algorithms; does not require to specify a function space where to search for the expert's reward function. Leveraging on the fact that the policy gradient needs to be zero for any optimal policy; the algorithm generates a set of basis functions that span the subspace of reward functions that make the policy gradient vanish. Within this subspace; using a second-order criterion; we search for the reward function that penalizes the most a deviation from the expert's policy. After introducing our approach for finite domains; we extend it to continuous ones. The proposed approach is empirically compared to other IRL methods both in the (finite) Taxi domain and in the (continuous) Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) and Car on the Hill environments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6800-compatible-reward-inverse-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Alberto Maria Metelli; Matteo Pirotta; Marcello Restelli
2017,Neural Program Meta-Induction,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6803-neural-program-meta-induction.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6803-neural-program-meta-induction,Most recently proposed methods for Neural Program induction work under the assumption of having a large set of input/output (I/O) examples for learning any given input-output mapping. This paper aims to address the problem of data and computation efficiency of program induction by leveraging information from related tasks. Specifically; we propose two novel approaches for cross-task knowledge transfer to improve program induction in limited-data scenarios. In our first proposal; portfolio adaptation; a set of induction models is pretrained on a set of related tasks; and the best model is adapted towards the new task using transfer learning. In our second approach; meta program induction; a $k$-shot learning approach is used to make a model generalize to new tasks without additional training. To test the efficacy of our methods; we constructed a new benchmark of programs written in the Karel programming language. Using an extensive experimental evaluation on the Karel benchmark; we demonstrate that our proposals dramatically outperform the baseline induction method that does not use knowledge transfer. We also analyze the relative performance of the two approaches and study conditions in which they perform best. In particular; meta induction outperforms all existing approaches under extreme data sparsity (when a very small number of examples are available); i.e.; fewer than ten. As the number of available I/O examples increase (i.e. a thousand or more); portfolio adapted program induction becomes the best approach. For intermediate data sizes; we demonstrate that the combined method of adapted meta program induction has the strongest performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6803-neural-program-meta-induction/bibtex,Jacob Devlin; Rudy R.

2017,A graph-theoretic approach to multitasking,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6805-a-graph-theoretic-approach-to-multitasking.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6805-a-graph-theoretic-approach-to-multitasking,A key feature of neural network architectures is their ability to support the simultaneous interaction among large numbers of units in the learning and processing of representations. However; how the richness of such interactions trades off against the ability of a network to simultaneously carry out multiple independent processes -- a salient limitation in many domains of human cognition -- remains largely unexplored. In this paper we use a graph-theoretic analysis of network architecture to address this question; where tasks are represented as edges in a bipartite graph $G=(A \cup B; E)$. We define a new measure of multitasking capacity of such networks; based on the assumptions that tasks that \emph{need} to be multitasked rely on independent resources; i.e.; form a matching; and that tasks \emph{can} be performed without interference if they form an induced matching. Our main result is an inherent tradeoff between the multitasking capacity and the average degree of the network that holds \emph{regardless of the network architecture}. These results are also extended to networks of depth greater than $2$. On the positive side; we demonstrate that networks that are random-like (e.g.; locally sparse) can have desirable multitasking properties. Our results shed light into the parallel-processing limitations of neural systems and provide insights that may be useful for the analysis and design of parallel architectures.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6805-a-graph-theoretic-approach-to-multitasking/bibtex,Noga Alon; Daniel Reichman; Igor Shinkar; Tal Wagner; Sebastian Musslick; Jonathan D.

2017,First-Order Adaptive Sample Size Methods to Reduce Complexity of Empirical Risk Minimization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6801-first-order-adaptive-sample-size-methods-to-reduce-complexity-of-empirical-risk-minimization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6801-first-order-adaptive-sample-size-methods-to-reduce-complexity-of-empirical-risk-minimization,This paper studies empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems for large-scale datasets and incorporates the idea of adaptive sample size methods to improve the guaranteed convergence bounds for first-order stochastic and deterministic methods. In contrast to traditional methods that attempt to solve the ERM problem corresponding to the full dataset directly; adaptive sample size schemes start with a small number of samples and solve the corresponding ERM problem to its statistical accuracy. The sample size is then grown geometrically -- e.g.; scaling by a factor of two -- and use the solution of the previous ERM as a warm start for the new ERM. Theoretical analyses show that the use of adaptive sample size methods reduces the overall computational cost of achieving the statistical accuracy of the whole dataset for a broad range of deterministic and stochastic first-order methods. The gains are specific to the choice of method. When particularized to; e.g.; accelerated gradient descent and stochastic variance reduce gradient; the computational cost advantage is a logarithm of the number of training samples. Numerical experiments on various datasets confirm theoretical claims and showcase the gains of using the proposed adaptive sample size scheme.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6801-first-order-adaptive-sample-size-methods-to-reduce-complexity-of-empirical-risk-minimization/bibtex,Aryan Mokhtari; Alejandro Ribeiro

We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime where the number of observations are fewer than the dimension of the weight vector. We assume that the weight vector belongs to some closed set (convex or nonconvex) which captures known side-information about its structure. We focus on the realizable model where the inputs are chosen i.i.d.~from a Gaussian distribution and the labels are generated according to a planted weight vector. We show that projected gradient descent; when initialized at $\vct{0}$; converges at a linear rate to the planted model with a number of samples that is optimal up to numerical constants. Our results on the dynamics of convergence of these very shallow neural nets may provide some insights towards understanding the dynamics of deeper architectures.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6796-learning-relus-via-gradient-descent/bibtex,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi

Data-efficient solutions under small noise exist; such as PILCO which learns the cartpole swing-up task in 30s. PILCO evaluates policies by planning state-trajectories using a dynamics model. However; PILCO applies policies to the observed state; therefore planning in observation space. We extend PILCO with filtering to instead plan in belief space; consistent with partially observable Markov decisions process (POMDP) planning. This enables data-efficient learning under significant observation noise; outperforming more naive methods such as post-hoc application of a filter to policies optimised by the original (unfiltered) PILCO algorithm. We test our method on the cartpole swing-up task; which involves nonlinear dynamics and requires nonlinear control.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6799-data-efficient-reinforcement-learning-in-continuous-state-action-gaussian-pomdps/bibtex,Rowan McAllister; Carl Edward Rasmussen

The dictionary learning problem is to factorize vector samples $y^{1};y^{2};\ldots; y^{n}$ into an appropriate basis (dictionary) $A^*$ and sparse vectors $x^{1*};\ldots;x^{n*}$. Our algorithm is a simple alternating minimization procedure that switches between $\ell_1$ minimization and gradient descent in alternate steps. Dictionary learning and specifically alternating minimization algorithms for dictionary learning are well studied both theoretically and empirically. However; in contrast to previous theoretical analyses for this problem; we replace a condition on the operator norm (that is; the largest magnitude singular value) of the true underlying dictionary $A^*$ with a condition on the matrix infinity norm (that is; the largest magnitude term). This not only allows us to get convergence rates for the error of the estimated dictionary measured in the matrix infinity norm; but also ensures that a random initialization will provably converge to the global optimum. Our guarantees are under a reasonable generative model that allows for dictionaries with growing operator norms; and can handle an arbitrary level of overcompleteness; while having sparsity that is information theoretically optimal. We also establish upper bounds on the sample complexity of our algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6795-alternating-minimization-for-dictionary-learning-with-random-initialization/bibtex,Niladri Chatterji; Peter L.

2017,Stabilizing Training of Generative Adversarial Networks through Regularization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6797-stabilizing-training-of-generative-adversarial-networks-through-regularization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6797-stabilizing-training-of-generative-adversarial-networks-through-regularization,Deep generative models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated impressive sample quality but in order to work they require a careful choice of architecture; parameter initialization; and selection of hyper-parameters. This fragility is in part due to a dimensional mismatch or non-overlapping support between the model distribution and the data distribution; causing their density ratio and the associated f -divergence to be undefined. We overcome this fundamental limitation and propose a new regularization approach with low computational cost that yields a stable GAN training procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this regularizer accross several architectures trained on common benchmark image generation tasks. Our regularization turns GAN models into reliable building blocks for deep learning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6797-stabilizing-training-of-generative-adversarial-networks-through-regularization/bibtex,Kevin Roth; Aurelien Lucchi; Sebastian Nowozin; Thomas Hofmann

The combination of high-resolution observations; expressive dynamic models; and efficient machine learning algorithms can lead to crucial insights into complex interaction dynamics and the functions of these systems. In this paper; we formulate the dynamics of a complex interacting network as a stochastic process driven by a sequence of events; and develop expectation propagation algorithms to make inferences from noisy observations. To avoid getting stuck at a local optimum; we formulate the problem of minimizing Bethe free energy as a constrained primal problem and take advantage of the concavity of dual problem in the feasible domain of dual variables guaranteed by duality theorem. Our expectation propagation algorithms demonstrate better performance in inferring the interaction dynamics in complex transportation networks than competing models such as particle filter; extended Kalman filter; and deep neural networks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6798-expectation-propagation-with-stochastic-kinetic-model-in-complex-interaction-systems/bibtex,Le Fang; Fan Yang; Wen Dong; Tong Guan; Chunming Qiao

Most previous methods have focused on the case where tasks relations can be modeled as linear operators and regularization approaches can be used successfully. However; in practice assuming the tasks to be linearly related is often restrictive; and allowing for nonlinear structures is a challenge. In this paper; we tackle this issue by casting the problem within the framework of structured prediction. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm for learning multiple tasks which are related by a system of nonlinear equations that their joint outputs need to satisfy. We show that our algorithm can be efficiently implemented and study its generalization properties; proving universal consistency and learning rates. Our theoretical analysis highlights the benefits of non-linear multitask learning over learning the tasks independently. Encouraging experimental results show the benefits of the proposed method in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6794-consistent-multitask-learning-with-nonlinear-output-relations/bibtex,Carlo Ciliberto; Alessandro Rudi; Lorenzo Rosasco; Massimiliano Pontil

Despite the recent introduction of several algorithms with good empirical performance; it is unknown whether general optimal transport distances can be approximated in near-linear time. This paper demonstrates that this ambitious goal is in fact achieved by Cuturi's Sinkhorn Distances. This result relies on a new analysis of Sinkhorn iterations; which also directly suggests a new greedy coordinate descent algorithm Greenkhorn with the same theoretical guarantees. Numerical simulations  illustrate that Greenkhorn significantly outperforms the classical Sinkhorn algorithm in practice.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6792-near-linear-time-approximation-algorithms-for-optimal-transport-via-sinkhorn-iteration/bibtex,Jason Altschuler; Jonathan Weed; Philippe Rigollet

We show that different priors result in different decompositions of information between the latent code and the autoregressive decoder. For example; by imposing a Gaussian distribution as the prior; we can achieve a global vs. local decomposition; or by imposing a categorical distribution as the prior; we can disentangle the style and content information of images in an unsupervised fashion.

2017,Batch Renormalization: Towards Reducing Minibatch Dependence in Batch-Normalized Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6790-batch-renormalization-towards-reducing-minibatch-dependence-in-batch-normalized-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6790-batch-renormalization-towards-reducing-minibatch-dependence-in-batch-normalized-models,Batch Normalization is quite effective at accelerating and improving the training of deep models. However; its effectiveness diminishes when the training minibatches are small; or do not consist of independent samples. We hypothesize that this is due to the dependence of model layer inputs on all the examples in the minibatch; and different activations being produced between training and inference. We propose Batch Renormalization; a simple and effective extension to ensure that the training and inference models generate the same outputs that depend on individual examples rather than the entire minibatch. Models trained with Batch Renormalization perform substantially better than batchnorm when training with small  or non-i.i.d. minibatches. At the same time; Batch Renormalization retains the benefits of batchnorm such as insensitivity to initialization and training efficiency.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6790-batch-renormalization-towards-reducing-minibatch-dependence-in-batch-normalized-models/bibtex,Sergey Ioffe
2017,Revisit Fuzzy Neural Network: Demystifying Batch Normalization and ReLU with Generalized Hamming Network,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6788-revisit-fuzzy-neural-network-demystifying-batch-normalization-and-relu-with-generalized-hamming-network.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6788-revisit-fuzzy-neural-network-demystifying-batch-normalization-and-relu-with-generalized-hamming-network,We revisit fuzzy neural network with a cornerstone notion of generalized hamming distance; which provides a novel and theoretically justified framework to re-interpret many useful neural network techniques in terms of fuzzy logic. In particular; we conjecture and empirically illustrate that; the celebrated batch normalization (BN) technique actually adapts the ?normalized? bias such that it approximates the rightful bias induced by the generalized hamming distance. Once the due bias is enforced analytically; neither the optimization of bias terms nor the sophisticated batch normalization is needed. Also in the light of generalized hamming distance; the popular rectified linear units (ReLU) can be treated as setting a minimal hamming distance threshold between network inputs and weights. This thresholding scheme; on the one hand; can be improved by introducing double-thresholding on both positive and negative extremes of neuron outputs. On the other hand; ReLUs turn out to be non-essential and can be removed from networks trained for simple tasks like MNIST classification. The proposed generalized hamming network (GHN) as such not only lends itself to rigorous analysis and interpretation within the fuzzy logic theory but also demonstrates fast learning speed; well-controlled behaviour and state-of-the-art performances on a variety of learning tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6788-revisit-fuzzy-neural-network-demystifying-batch-normalization-and-relu-with-generalized-hamming-network/bibtex,Lixin Fan
2017,Generating steganographic images via adversarial training,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6791-generating-steganographic-images-via-adversarial-training.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6791-generating-steganographic-images-via-adversarial-training,Adversarial training has proved to be competitive against supervised learning methods on computer vision tasks. However; studies have mainly been confined to generative tasks such as image synthesis. In this paper; we apply adversarial training techniques to the discriminative task of learning a steganographic algorithm. Steganography is a collection of techniques for concealing the existence of information by embedding it within a non-secret medium; such as cover texts or images. We show that adversarial training can produce robust steganographic techniques: our unsupervised training scheme produces a steganographic algorithm that competes with state-of-the-art steganographic techniques. We also show that supervised training of our adversarial model produces a robust steganalyzer; which performs the discriminative task of deciding if an image contains secret information. We define a game between three parties; Alice; Bob and Eve; in order to simultaneously train both a steganographic algorithm and a steganalyzer. Alice and Bob attempt to communicate a secret message contained within an image; while Eve eavesdrops on their conversation and attempts to determine if secret information is embedded within the image. We represent Alice; Bob and Eve by neural networks; and validate our scheme on two independent image datasets; showing our novel method of studying steganographic problems is surprisingly competitive against established steganographic techniques.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6791-generating-steganographic-images-via-adversarial-training/bibtex,Jamie Hayes; George Danezis

In order to speed up the estimation of the sparse plus low-rank components; we propose a sparsity constrained maximum likelihood estimator based on matrix factorization and an efficient alternating gradient descent algorithm with hard thresholding to solve it. Our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the convex relaxation based methods for LVGGM. In addition; we prove that our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown sparse and low-rank components up to the optimal statistical precision. Experiments on both synthetic and genomic data demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms and corroborate our theory.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6789-speeding-up-latent-variable-gaussian-graphical-model-estimation-via-nonconvex-optimization/bibtex,Pan Xu; Jian Ma; Quanquan Gu

Existing algorithms generally formulate the task as selection from a set of bounding box proposals obtained from deep net based systems. In this work; we demonstrate that we can cast the problem of textual grounding into a unified framework that permits efficient search over all possible bounding boxes. Hence; the method is able to consider significantly more proposals and doesn?t rely on a successful first stage hypothesizing bounding box proposals. Beyond; we demonstrate that the trained parameters of our model can be used as word-embeddings which capture spatial-image relationships and provide interpretability. Lastly; at the time of submission; our approach outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods on the Flickr 30k Entities and the ReferItGame dataset by 3.08% and 7.77% respectively.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6787-interpretable-and-globally-optimal-prediction-for-textual-grounding-using-image-concepts/bibtex,Raymond Yeh; Jinjun Xiong; Wen-Mei Hwu; Minh Do; Alexander Schwing
2017,Lookahead  Bayesian Optimization with Inequality Constraints,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6785-lookahead-bayesian-optimization-with-inequality-constraints.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6785-lookahead-bayesian-optimization-with-inequality-constraints,We consider the task of optimizing an objective function subject to inequality constraints when both the objective and the constraints are expensive to evaluate. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular way to tackle optimization problems with expensive objective function evaluations; but has mostly been applied to unconstrained problems. Several BO approaches have been proposed to address expensive constraints but are limited to greedy strategies maximizing immediate reward. To address this limitation; we propose a lookahead approach that selects the next evaluation in order to maximize the long-term feasible reduction of the objective function. We present numerical experiments demonstrating the performance improvements of such a lookahead approach compared to several greedy BO algorithms; including constrained expected improvement (EIC) and predictive entropy search with constraint (PESC).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6785-lookahead-bayesian-optimization-with-inequality-constraints/bibtex,Remi Lam; Karen Willcox

Despite their theoretical appeal; the applicability of these methods to real data is still limited due to a lack of robustness to model misspecification. In this paper we present a hierarchical approach to methods of moments to circumvent such limitations. Our method is based on replacing the tensor decomposition step used in previous algorithms with approximate joint diagonalization. Experiments on topic modeling show that our method outperforms previous tensor decomposition methods in terms of speed and model quality.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6786-hierarchical-methods-of-moments/bibtex,Matteo Ruffini; Guillaume Rabusseau; Borja Balle

Specifically; we exploit the multi-scale nature of information in sequential data by formulating it explicitly within a factorized hierarchical graphical model that imposes sequence-dependent priors and sequence-independent priors to different sets of latent variables. The model is evaluated on two speech corpora to demonstrate; qualitatively; its ability to transform speakers or linguistic content by manipulating different sets of latent variables; and quantitatively; its ability to outperform an i-vector baseline for speaker verification and reduce the word error rate by as much as 35% in mismatched train/test scenarios for automatic speech recognition tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6784-unsupervised-learning-of-disentangled-and-interpretable-representations-from-sequential-data/bibtex,Wei-Ning Hsu; Yu Zhang; James Glass

The algorithm is based on branch and bound and integrates dynamic programming for both domain pruning and for obtaining strong bounds for search-space pruning. Empirically; we show that the approach dominates in terms of running times a recent integer programming approach (and thereby also a recent constraint optimization approach) for the problem. Furthermore; our algorithm scales at times further with respect to the number of variables than a state-of-the-art dynamic programming algorithm for the problem; with the potential of reaching 20 variables and at the same time circumventing the tight exponential lower bounds on memory consumption of the pure dynamic programming approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6781-learning-chordal-markov-networks-via-branch-and-bound/bibtex,Kari Rantanen; Antti Hyttinen; Matti J?rvisalo

Using the formalism of smooth two-player games we analyze the associated gradient vector field of GAN training objectives. Our findings suggest that the convergence of current algorithms suffers due to two factors: i) presence of eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the gradient vector field with zero real-part; and ii) eigenvalues with big imaginary part. Using these findings; we design a new algorithm that overcomes some of these limitations and has better convergence properties. Experimentally; we demonstrate its superiority on training common GAN architectures and show convergence on GAN architectures that are known to be notoriously hard to train.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6779-the-numerics-of-gans/bibtex,Lars Mescheder; Sebastian Nowozin; Andreas Geiger

Each time the human is surprised; the agent is provided a demonstration of the desired behavior by the human.

Fitting these models implies a difficult optimization problem over complex; possibly noisy parameter landscapes. Bayesian optimization (BO) has been successfully applied to solving expensive black-box problems in engineering and machine learning.  Here we explore whether BO can be applied as a general tool for model fitting. First; we present a novel hybrid BO algorithm; Bayesian adaptive direct search (BADS); that achieves competitive performance with an affordable computational overhead for the running time of typical models. We then perform an extensive benchmark of BADS vs. many common and state-of-the-art nonconvex; derivative-free optimizers; on a set of model-fitting problems with real data and models from six studies in behavioral; cognitive; and computational neuroscience. With default settings; BADS consistently finds comparable or better solutions than other methods; including `vanilla' BO; showing great promise for advanced BO techniques; and BADS in particular; as a general model-fitting tool.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6780-practical-bayesian-optimization-for-model-fitting-with-bayesian-adaptive-direct-search/bibtex,Luigi Acerbi; Wei Ji

We perform exact clustering with high probability using a convex semidefinite estimator that interprets as a corrected; relaxed version of K-means. The estimator is analyzed through a non-asymptotic framework and showed to be optimal or near-optimal in recovering the partition. Furthermore; its performances are shown to be adaptive to the problem?s effective dimension; as well as to K the unknown number of groups in this partition. We illustrate the method?s performances in comparison to other classical clustering algorithms with numerical experiments on simulated high-dimensional data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6776-adaptive-clustering-through-semidefinite-programming/bibtex,Martin Royer

This is due to the heterogeneity of ad opportunity types; and the non-convexity of the objective function. In this work; we show how to reduce reserve price optimization to the standard setting of prediction under squared loss; a well understood problem in the learning community.  We further bound the gap between the expected bid and revenue in terms of the average loss of the predictor. This is the first result that formally relates the revenue gained to the quality of a standard machine learned model.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6782-revenue-optimization-with-approximate-bid-predictions/bibtex,Andres Munoz; Sergei Vassilvitskii

In this paper; we show that a state/action value estimated using the Bellman equation can be decomposed to a weighted sum of path-wise values that follow log-normal distributions. Since log-normal distributions are skewed; the distribution of estimated state/action values can also be skewed; leading to an imbalanced likelihood of under/overestimation. The degree of such imbalance can vary greatly among actions and policies within a single problem instance; making the agent prone to select actions/policies that have inferior expected return and higher likelihood of overestimation. We present a comprehensive analysis to such skewness; examine its factors and impacts through both theoretical and empirical results; and discuss the possible ways to reduce its undesirable effects.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6777-log-normality-and-skewness-of-estimated-stateaction-values-in-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,Liangpeng Zhang; Ke Tang; Xin Yao

We put forth a novel procedure; that starts with a \emph{weighted maximal correlation initialization} obtainable with a few power iterations; followed by successive refinements based on \emph{iteratively reweighted gradient-type iterations}. The novel techniques distinguish themselves from prior works by the inclusion of a fresh (re)weighting regularization. For certain random measurement models; the proposed procedure returns the true solution $\bm{x}$ with high probability in time proportional to reading the data $\{(\bm{a}_i;y_i)\}_{1\le i \le m}$; provided that the number $m$ of equations is some constant $c>0$ times the number $n$ of unknowns; that is; $m\ge cn$. Empirically; the upshots of this contribution are: i) perfect signal recovery in the high-dimensional regime given only an \emph{information-theoretic limit number} of equations; and; ii) (near-)optimal statistical accuracy in the presence of additive noise. Extensive numerical tests using both synthetic data and real images corroborate its improved signal recovery performance and computational efficiency relative to state-of-the-art approaches.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6783-solving-most-systems-of-random-quadratic-equations/bibtex,Gang Wang; Georgios Giannakis; Yousef Saad; Jie Chen

However; deliberation is a common behavior in human's daily life like reading news and writing papers/articles/books. In this work; we introduce the deliberation process into the encoder-decoder framework and propose deliberation networks for sequence generation. A deliberation network has two levels of decoders; where the first-pass decoder generates a raw sequence and the second-pass decoder polishes and refines the raw sentence with deliberation. Since the second-pass deliberation decoder has global information about what the sequence to be generated might be; it has the potential to generate a better sequence by looking into future words in the raw sentence. Experiments on neural machine translation and text summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deliberation networks. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task; our model establishes a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.5.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6775-deliberation-networks-sequence-generation-beyond-one-pass-decoding/bibtex,Yingce Xia; Fei Tian; Lijun Wu; Jianxin Lin; Tao Qin; Nenghai Yu; Tie-Yan Liu

Recently; neural networks have been applied to this problem with promising results. By exploiting massively parallel GPU processing architectures and oodles of training data; they can run orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques. However; these methods are largely unprincipled black boxes that are difficult to train and often-times specific to a single measurement matrix.  It was recently demonstrated that iterative sparse-signal-recovery algorithms can be ``unrolled?' to form interpretable deep networks. Taking inspiration from this work; we develop a novel neural network architecture that mimics the behavior of the denoising-based approximate message passing (D-AMP) algorithm. We call this new network {\em Learned} D-AMP (LDAMP).  The LDAMP network is easy to train; can be applied to a variety of different measurement matrices; and comes with a state-evolution heuristic that accurately predicts its performance. Most importantly; it outperforms the state-of-the-art BM3D-AMP and NLR-CS algorithms in terms of both accuracy and run time. At high resolutions; and when used with sensing matrices that have fast implementations; LDAMP runs over $50\times$ faster than BM3D-AMP and hundreds of times faster than NLR-CS.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6774-learned-d-amp-principled-neural-network-based-compressive-image-recovery/bibtex,Chris Metzler; Ali Mousavi; Richard Baraniuk

Most existing structures (e.g. linear; lipschitz; unimodal; combinatorial; dueling;...) are covered by our framework. We derive an asymptotic instance-specific regret lower bound for these problems; and develop OSSB; an algorithm whose regret matches this fundamental limit. OSSB is not based on the classical principle of ``optimism in the face of uncertainty'' or on Thompson sampling; and rather aims at matching the minimal exploration rates of sub-optimal arms as characterized in the derivation of the regret lower bound. We illustrate the efficiency of OSSB using numerical experiments in the case of the linear bandit problem and show that OSSB outperforms existing algorithms; including Thompson sampling,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6773-minimal-exploration-in-structured-stochastic-bandits/bibtex,Richard Combes; Stefan Magureanu; Alexandre Proutiere

This allows us to develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) training algorithm consisting of a sequence of numerically well-behaved convex optimizations. Using ideas from proximal point methods in convex analysis; we prove that this BCD algorithm will converge globally to a stationary point with R-linear convergence rate of order one. In experiments with the MNIST database; DNNs trained with this BCD algorithm consistently yielded better test-set error rates than identical DNN architectures trained via all the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants in the Caffe toolbox.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6769-convergent-block-coordinate-descent-for-training-tikhonov-regularized-deep-neural-networks/bibtex,Ziming Zhang; Matthew Brand

For many probabilistic models; computation of the marginal likelihood is challenging; because it involves a sum or integral over an enormous parameter space. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a powerful approach to compute marginal likelihoods. Various MCMC algorithms and evidence estimators have been proposed in the literature. Here we discuss the use of nonequilibrium techniques for estimating the marginal likelihood. Nonequilibrium estimators build on recent developments in statistical physics and are known as annealed importance sampling (AIS) and reverse AIS in probabilistic machine learning. We introduce estimators for the model evidence that combine forward and backward simulations and show for various challenging models that the evidence estimators outperform forward and reverse AIS.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6772-model-evidence-from-nonequilibrium-simulations/bibtex,Michael Habeck

We examine an M-wise comparison model that builds on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model where for each sample; M items are ranked according to their perceived utilities modeled as noisy observations of their underlying true utilities. As our result; we characterize the minimax optimality on the sample size for top-K ranking. The optimal sample size turns out to be inversely proportional to M. We devise an algorithm that effectively converts M-wise samples into pairwise ones and employs a spectral method using the refined data. In demonstrating its optimality; we develop a novel technique for deriving tight $\ell_\infty$ estimation error bounds; which is key to accurately analyzing the performance of top-K ranking algorithms; but has been challenging. Recent work relied on an additional maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) stage merged with a spectral method to attain good estimates in $\ell_\infty$ error to achieve the limit for the pairwise model. In contrast; although it is valid in slightly restricted regimes; our result demonstrates a spectral method alone to be sufficient for the general M-wise model. We run numerical experiments using synthetic data and confirm that the optimal sample size decreases at the rate of 1/M. Moreover; running our algorithm on real-world data; we find that its applicability extends to settings that may not fit the PL model.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6766-optimal-sample-complexity-of-m-wise-data-for-top-k-ranking/bibtex,Minje Jang; Sunghyun Kim; Changho Suh; Sewoong Oh

The model based on the Poisson Factor Analysis method captures dependence among time steps by neural networks; representing the implicit distributions. Local complicated relationship is obtained from local implicit distribution; and deep latent structure is exploited to get the long-time dependence.

2017,Train longer; generalize better: closing the generalization gap in large batch training of neural networks,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6770-train-longer-generalize-better-closing-the-generalization-gap-in-large-batch-training-of-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6770-train-longer-generalize-better-closing-the-generalization-gap-in-large-batch-training-of-neural-networks,Background: Deep learning models are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent or one of its variants. These methods update the weights using their gradient; estimated from a small fraction of the training data. It has been observed that when using large batch sizes there is a persistent degradation in generalization performance -  known as the "generalization gap" phenomenon. Identifying the origin of this gap and closing it had remained an open problem.  Contributions: We examine the initial high learning rate training phase. We find that the weight distance from its initialization grows logarithmically with the number of weight updates. We therefore propose a "random walk on a random landscape" statistical model which is known to exhibit similar "ultra-slow" diffusion behavior. Following this hypothesis we conducted experiments to show empirically that the "generalization gap" stems from the relatively small number of updates rather than the batch size; and can be completely eliminated by adapting the training regime used. We further investigate different techniques to train models in the large-batch regime and present a novel algorithm named "Ghost Batch Normalization" which enables significant decrease in the generalization gap without increasing the number of updates. To validate our findings we conduct several additional experiments on MNIST; CIFAR-10; CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Finally; we reassess common practices and beliefs concerning training of deep models and suggest they may not be optimal to achieve good generalization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6770-train-longer-generalize-better-closing-the-generalization-gap-in-large-batch-training-of-neural-networks/bibtex,Elad Hoffer; Itay Hubara; Daniel Soudry
2017,QSGD: Communication-Efficient SGD via Gradient Quantization and Encoding,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6768-qsgd-communication-efficient-sgd-via-gradient-quantization-and-encoding.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6768-qsgd-communication-efficient-sgd-via-gradient-quantization-and-encoding,Parallel implementations of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have received significant research attention; thanks to its excellent scalability properties. A fundamental barrier when parallelizing SGD is the high bandwidth cost of communicating gradient updates between nodes; consequently; several lossy compresion heuristics have been proposed; by which nodes only communicate quantized gradients. Although effective in practice; these heuristics do not always guarantee convergence; and it is not clear whether they can be improved.  In this paper; we propose Quantized SGD (QSGD); a family of compression schemes for gradient updates which provides convergence guarantees. QSGD allows the user to smoothly trade off \emph{communication bandwidth} and \emph{convergence time}: nodes can adjust the number of bits sent per iteration; at the cost of possibly higher variance. We show that this trade-off is inherent; in the sense that improving it past some threshold would violate  information-theoretic lower bounds. QSGD guarantees convergence for convex and non-convex objectives;  under asynchrony; and can be extended to stochastic variance-reduced techniques.   When applied to  training deep neural networks for image classification and  automated speech recognition; QSGD leads to significant reductions in  end-to-end training time. For example; on 16GPUs; we can train the ResNet152  network to full accuracy on ImageNet 1.8x faster than the full-precision  variant.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6768-qsgd-communication-efficient-sgd-via-gradient-quantization-and-encoding/bibtex,Dan Alistarh; Demjan Grubic; Jerry Li; Ryota Tomioka; Milan Vojnovic

Our variant allows for tighter convergence bounds for extreme values of the CDF.  We apply our bound in the context of revenue learning; which is a well-studied problem in economics and algorithmic game theory. We derive sample-complexity bounds on the uniform convergence rate of the empirical revenues to the true revenues; assuming a bound on the k'th moment of the valuations; for any (possibly fractional) k > 1.  For uniform convergence in the limit; we give a complete characterization and a zero-one law: if the first moment of the valuations is finite; then uniform convergence almost surely occurs; conversely; if the first moment is infinite; then uniform convergence almost never occurs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6763-submultiplicative-glivenko-cantelli-and-uniform-convergence-of-revenues/bibtex,Noga Alon; Moshe Babaioff; Yannai A.

Significant gains in performance and energy efficiency could be realized by training and inference in numerical formats optimized for deep learning. Despite advances in limited precision inference in recent years; training of neural networks in low bit-width remains a challenging problem. Here we present the Flexpoint data format; aiming at a complete replacement of 32-bit floating point format training and inference; designed to support modern deep network topologies without modifications. Flexpoint tensors have a shared exponent that is dynamically adjusted to minimize overflows and maximize available dynamic range. We validate Flexpoint by training AlexNet; a deep residual network and a generative adversarial network; using a simulator implemented with the \emph{neon} deep learning framework. We demonstrate that 16-bit Flexpoint closely matches 32-bit floating point in training all three models; without any need for tuning of model hyperparameters. Our results suggest Flexpoint as a promising numerical format for future hardware for training and inference.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6771-flexpoint-an-adaptive-numerical-format-for-efficient-training-of-deep-neural-networks/bibtex,Urs K?ster; Tristan Webb; Xin Wang; Marcel Nassar; Arjun K.

However; if its model is very flexible; empirical risks on training data will go negative; and we will suffer from serious overfitting. In this paper; we propose a non-negative risk estimator for PU learning: when getting minimized; it is more robust against overfitting; and thus we are able to use very flexible models (such as deep neural networks) given limited P data. Moreover; we analyze the bias; consistency; and mean-squared-error reduction of the proposed risk estimator; and bound the estimation error of the resulting empirical risk minimizer. Experiments demonstrate that our risk estimator fixes the overfitting problem of its unbiased counterparts.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6765-positive-unlabeled-learning-with-non-negative-risk-estimator/bibtex,Ryuichi Kiryo; Gang Niu; Marthinus C. du Plessis; Masashi Sugiyama

Predicting user activities based on point processes is a central problem. However; existing works are mostly problem specific; use heuristics; or simplify the stochastic nature of point processes. In this paper; we propose a framework that provides an unbiased estimator of the probability mass function of point processes. In particular; we design a key reformulation of the prediction problem; and further derive a differential-difference equation to compute a conditional probability mass function. Our framework is applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks; and achieves superb predictive and efficiency performance in diverse real-world applications compared to state-of-arts.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6762-predicting-user-activity-level-in-point-processes-with-mass-transport-equation/bibtex,Yichen Wang; Xiaojing Ye; Hongyuan Zha; Le Song
2017,Reliable Decision Support using Counterfactual Models,Oral,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6767-reliable-decision-support-using-counterfactual-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6767-reliable-decision-support-using-counterfactual-models,Decision-makers are faced with the challenge of estimating what is likely to happen when they take an action. For instance; if I choose not to treat this patient; are they likely to die? Practitioners commonly use supervised learning algorithms to fit predictive models that help decision-makers reason about likely future outcomes; but we show that this approach is unreliable; and sometimes even dangerous. The key issue is that supervised learning algorithms are highly sensitive to the policy used to choose actions in the training data; which causes the model to capture relationships that do not generalize. We propose using a different learning objective that predicts counterfactuals instead of predicting outcomes under an existing action policy as in supervised learning. To support decision-making in temporal settings; we introduce the Counterfactual Gaussian Process (CGP) to predict the counterfactual future progression of continuous-time trajectories under sequences of future actions. We demonstrate the benefits of the CGP on two important decision-support tasks: risk prediction and ?what if?? reasoning for individualized treatment planning.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6767-reliable-decision-support-using-counterfactual-models/bibtex,Peter Schulam; Suchi Saria
2017,Deep Learning with Topological Signatures,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6761-deep-learning-with-topological-signatures.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6761-deep-learning-with-topological-signatures,Inferring topological and geometrical information from data can offer an alternative perspective in machine learning problems. Methods from topological data analysis; e.g.; persistent homology; enable us to obtain such information; typically in the form of summary representations of topological features. However; such topological signatures often  come with an unusual structure (e.g.; multisets of intervals) that is highly impractical for most machine learning techniques. While many strategies have been proposed to map these topological signatures into machine learning compatible representations; they suffer from being agnostic to the target learning task. In contrast; we propose a technique that enables us to input topological signatures to deep neural networks and learn a task-optimal representation during training. Our approach is realized as a novel input layer with favorable theoretical properties. Classification experiments on 2D object shapes and social network graphs demonstrate the versatility of the approach and; in case of the latter; we even outperform the state-of-the-art by a large margin.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6761-deep-learning-with-topological-signatures/bibtex,Christoph Hofer; Roland Kwitt; Marc Niethammer; Andreas Uhl

Unfortunately; these techniques are unable to deal with stochastic perturbations of input data; induced for example by data augmentation. In such cases; the objective is no longer a finite sum; and the main candidate for optimization is the stochastic gradient descent method (SGD). In this paper; we introduce a variance reduction approach for these settings when the objective is composite and strongly convex. The convergence rate outperforms SGD with a typically much smaller constant factor; which depends on the variance of gradient estimates only due to perturbations on a single example.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6760-stochastic-optimization-with-variance-reduction-for-infinite-datasets-with-finite-sum-structure/bibtex,Alberto Bietti; Julien Mairal

In the offline optimization setting; our derived methods are shown to obtain favourable adaptive  guarantees which depend on the harmonic sum of the queried gradients.  We further  show that our methods implicitly adapt to the objective's structure: in the smooth case fast  convergence rates are ensured without any prior knowledge of the smoothness parameter; while  still maintaining guarantees in the non-smooth setting. Our approach has a natural extension to the stochastic setting; resulting in a lazy version of SGD  (stochastic GD); where minibathces are chosen adaptively depending on the magnitude of  the gradients. Thus providing a principled approach towards choosing minibatch sizes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6759-online-to-offline-conversions-universality-and-adaptive-minibatch-sizes/bibtex,Kfir Levy

Unlink previous methods; DHA is not limited by a restricted fixed kernel function. Further; it uses a parametric approach; rank-m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD); and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Therefore; DHA has a suitable time complexity for large datasets; and DHA does not require the training data when it computes the functional alignment for a new subject. Experimental studies on multi-subject fMRI analysis confirm that the DHA method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art HA algorithms.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6758-deep-hyperalignment/bibtex,Muhammad Yousefnezhad; Daoqiang Zhang
2017,Learning Multiple Tasks with Multilinear Relationship Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6757-learning-multiple-tasks-with-multilinear-relationship-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6757-learning-multiple-tasks-with-multilinear-relationship-networks,Deep networks trained on large-scale data can learn transferable features to promote learning multiple tasks. Since deep features eventually transition from general to specific along deep networks; a fundamental problem of multi-task learning is how to exploit the task relatedness underlying  parameter tensors and improve feature transferability in the multiple task-specific layers. This paper presents Multilinear Relationship Networks (MRN) that discover the task relationships based on novel tensor normal priors over parameter tensors of multiple task-specific layers in deep convolutional networks. By jointly learning transferable features and multilinear relationships of tasks and features; MRN is able to alleviate the dilemma of negative-transfer in the feature layers and under-transfer in the classifier layer. Experiments show that MRN yields state-of-the-art results on three multi-task learning datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6757-learning-multiple-tasks-with-multilinear-relationship-networks/bibtex,Mingsheng Long; ZHANGJIE CAO; Jianmin Wang; Philip S.

In many domains; the two processes are approached through \emph{rules}: high-level principles that reveal invariances within similar yet diverse examples. Under a probabilistic setting for discrete input spaces; we focus on the rule realization problem which generates input sample distributions that follow the given rules. More ambitiously; we go beyond a mechanical realization that takes whatever is given; but instead ask for proactively selecting reasonable rules to realize. This goal is demanding in practice; since the initial rule set may not always be consistent and thus intelligent compromises are needed. We formulate both rule realization and selection as two strongly connected components within a single and symmetric bi-convex problem; and derive an efficient algorithm that works at large scale. Taking music compositional rules as the main example throughout the paper; we demonstrate our model's efficiency in not only music realization (composition) but also music interpretation and understanding (analysis).,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6754-probabilistic-rule-realization-and-selection/bibtex,Haizi Yu; Tianxi Li; Lav R.

This algorithm is derived from sample compression bounds and enjoys the statistical advantages of tight; fully empirical generalization bounds; as well as the algorithmic advantages of a faster runtime and memory savings. We prove that this algorithm is strongly Bayes-consistent in metric spaces with finite doubling dimension --- the first consistency result for an efficient nearest-neighbor sample compression scheme. Rather surprisingly; we discover that this algorithm continues to be Bayes-consistent even in a certain infinite-dimensional setting; in which the basic measure-theoretic conditions on which classic consistency proofs hinge are violated. This is all the more surprising; since it is known that k-NN is not Bayes-consistent in this setting. We pose several challenging open problems for future research.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6755-nearest-neighbor-sample-compression-efficiency-consistency-infinite-dimensions/bibtex,Aryeh Kontorovich; Sivan Sabato; Roi Weiss

Sometimes this is in the form of a bound on the payoffs; or the knowledge of a variance or subgaussian parameter. The notable exceptions are the analysis of Gaussian bandits with unknown mean and variance by Cowan and Katehakis [2015a] and of uniform distributions with unknown support [Cowan and Katehakis; 2015b]. The results derived in these specialised cases are generalised here to the non-parametric setup; where the learner knows only a bound on the kurtosis of the noise; which is a scale free measure of the extremity of outliers.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6756-a-scale-free-algorithm-for-stochastic-bandits-with-bounded-kurtosis/bibtex,Tor Lattimore

Prediction cost can be drastically reduced if the learned predictor is constructed such that on the majority of the inputs; it uses cheap features and fast evaluations. The main challenge is to do so with little loss in accuracy. In this work we propose a budget-aware strategy based on deep boosted regression trees. In contrast to previous approaches to learning with cost penalties; our method can grow very deep trees that on average are nonetheless cheap to compute. We evaluate our method on a number of datasets and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by a large margin. Our algorithm is easy to implement and its learning time is comparable to that of the original gradient boosting.

2017,NeuralFDR: Learning Discovery Thresholds from Hypothesis Features,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6752-neuralfdr-learning-discovery-thresholds-from-hypothesis-features.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6752-neuralfdr-learning-discovery-thresholds-from-hypothesis-features,As datasets grow richer; an important challenge is to leverage the full features in the data to maximize the number of useful discoveries while controlling for false positives. We address this problem in the context of multiple hypotheses testing; where for each hypothesis; we observe a p-value along with a set of features specific to that hypothesis. For example; in genetic association studies; each hypothesis tests the correlation between a variant and the trait. We have a rich set of features for each variant (e.g. its location; conservation; epigenetics etc.) which could inform how likely the variant is to have a true association. However popular testing approaches; such as Benjamini-Hochberg's procedure (BH) and independent hypothesis weighting (IHW); either ignore these features or assume that the features are categorical. We propose a new algorithm; NeuralFDR; which automatically learns a discovery threshold as a function of all the hypothesis features. We parametrize the discovery threshold as a neural network; which enables flexible handling of multi-dimensional discrete and continuous features as well as efficient end-to-end optimization. We prove that NeuralFDR has strong false discovery rate (FDR) guarantees; and show that it makes substantially more discoveries in synthetic and real datasets. Moreover; we demonstrate that the learned discovery threshold is directly interpretable.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6752-neuralfdr-learning-discovery-thresholds-from-hypothesis-features/bibtex,Fei Xia; Martin J.

We show that by constructing a row/column linear propagation model; the spatially variant transformation matrix constitutes an affinity matrix that models dense; global pairwise similarities of an image. Specifically; we develop a three-way connection for the linear propagation model; which (a) formulates a sparse transformation matrix where all elements can be the output from a deep CNN; but (b) results in a dense affinity matrix that is effective to model any task-specific pairwise similarity. Instead of designing the similarity kernels according to image features of two points; we can directly output all similarities in a pure data-driven manner. The spatial propagation network is a generic framework that can be applied to numerous tasks; which traditionally benefit from designed affinity; e.g.; image matting; colorization; and guided filtering; to name a few. Furthermore; the model can also learn semantic-aware affinity for high-level vision tasks due to the learning capability of the deep model. We validate the proposed framework by refinement of object segmentation. Experiments on the HELEN face parsing and PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic segmentation tasks show that the spatial propagation network provides general; effective and efficient solutions for generating high-quality segmentation results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6750-learning-affinity-via-spatial-propagation-networks/bibtex,Sifei Liu; Shalini De Mello; Jinwei Gu; Guangyu Zhong; Ming-Hsuan Yang; Jan Kautz

First; a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme is given for the natural least squares optimization problem in any constant dimension. Next; in an average-case and noise-free setting where the responses exactly correspond to a linear function of i.i.d. draws from a standard multivariate normal distribution; an efficient algorithm based on lattice basis reduction is shown to exactly recover the unknown linear function in arbitrary dimension. Finally; lower bounds on the signal-to-noise ratio are established for approximate recovery of the unknown linear function by any estimator.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6751-linear-regression-without-correspondence/bibtex,Daniel J.

In this work; we propose TernGrad that uses ternary gradients to accelerate distributed deep learning in data parallelism. Our approach requires only three numerical levels {-1;0;1}; which can aggressively reduce the communication time. We mathematically prove the convergence of TernGrad under the assumption of a bound on gradients. Guided by the bound; we propose layer-wise ternarizing and gradient clipping to improve its convergence. Our experiments show that applying TernGrad on AlexNet does not incur any accuracy loss and can even improve accuracy. The accuracy loss of GoogLeNet induced by TernGrad is less than 2% on average. Finally; a performance model is proposed to study the scalability of TernGrad. Experiments show significant speed gains for various deep neural networks.

In this paper; we address a dueling bandit problem based on a cost function over a continuous space.   We propose a stochastic mirror descent algorithm  and show that  the algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$-regret bound under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions for the cost function. Then; we clarify the equivalence between regret minimization in dueling bandit and convex optimization for the cost function.  Moreover; considering a lower bound in convex optimization; it is turned out that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate in convex optimization and the optimal regret in dueling bandit except for a logarithmic factor.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6747-regret-analysis-for-continuous-dueling-bandit/bibtex,Wataru Kumagai

Subsequently; she has to identify the value of a new instance as accurately as possible. In this work; we initiate the study of strategic predictions in machine learning.  We consider a regression task tackled by two players; where the payoff of each player is the proportion of the points she predicts more accurately than the other player. We first revise the probably approximately correct learning framework to deal with the case of a duel between two predictors.  We then devise an algorithm which finds a linear regression predictor that is a best response to any (not necessarily linear) regression algorithm. We show that it has linearithmic sample complexity; and polynomial time complexity when the dimension of the instances domain is fixed. We also test our approach in a high-dimensional setting; and show it significantly defeats classical regression algorithms in the prediction duel. Together; our work introduces a novel machine learning task that lends itself well to current competitive online settings; provides its theoretical foundations; and illustrates its applicability.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6748-best-response-regression/bibtex,Omer Ben Porat; Moshe Tennenholtz

The basic idea of TranSync is to apply truncated least squares; where the solution at each step is used to gradually prune out noisy measurements. We analyze TranSync under both deterministic and randomized  noisy models; demonstrating its robustness and stability.

2017,A New Alternating Direction Method for Linear Programming,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6746-a-new-alternating-direction-method-for-linear-programming.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6746-a-new-alternating-direction-method-for-linear-programming,It is well known that; for a linear program (LP) with constraint matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$; the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier converges globally and linearly at a rate $O((\|\mathbf{A}\|_F^2+mn)\log(1/\epsilon))$. However; such a rate is related to the problem dimension and the algorithm exhibits a slow and fluctuating ``tail convergence'' in practice. In this paper; we propose a new variable splitting method of LP and prove that our method has a convergence rate of $O(\|\mathbf{A}\|^2\log(1/\epsilon))$. The proof is based on simultaneously estimating the distance from a pair of primal dual iterates to the optimal primal and dual solution set by certain residuals. In practice; we result in a new first-order LP solver that can exploit both the sparsity and the specific structure of matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and a  significant speedup for important problems such as basis pursuit; inverse covariance matrix estimation; L1 SVM and nonnegative matrix factorization problem compared with current fastest LP solvers.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6746-a-new-alternating-direction-method-for-linear-programming/bibtex,Sinong Wang; Ness Shroff

Choosing a misspecified model; or equivalently; an incorrect inference algorithm will result in an invalid analysis or even falsely uncover patterns that are in fact artifacts of the model. This work focuses on unifying two of the most widely used link-formation models: the stochastic block model (SBM) and the small world (or latent space) model (SWM). Integrating techniques from kernel learning; spectral graph theory; and nonlinear dimensionality reduction; we develop the first statistically sound polynomial-time algorithm to discover latent patterns in sparse graphs for both models. When the network comes from an SBM; the algorithm outputs a block structure. When it is from an SWM; the algorithm outputs estimates of each node's latent position.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6745-from-which-world-is-your-graph/bibtex,Cheng Li; Felix MF Wong; Zhenming Liu; Varun Kanade

Most techniques have focused on local approximate invariance implemented within expensive optimization frameworks lacking explicit theoretical guarantees. In this paper; we study kernels that are invariant to a unitary group while having theoretical guarantees in addressing the important practical issue of unavailability of transformed versions of labelled data. A problem we call the Unlabeled Transformation Problem which is a special form of semi-supervised learning and one-shot learning. We present a theoretically motivated alternate approach to the invariant kernel SVM based on which we propose Max-Margin Invariant Features (MMIF) to solve this problem. As an illustration; we design an framework for face recognition and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a large scale semi-synthetic dataset with 153;000 images and a new challenging protocol on Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) while out-performing strong baselines.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6742-max-margin-invariant-features-from-transformed-unlabelled-data/bibtex,Dipan Pal; Ashwin Kannan; Gautam Arakalgud; Marios Savvides
2017,Learning with Feature Evolvable Streams,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6740-learning-with-feature-evolvable-streams.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6740-learning-with-feature-evolvable-streams,Learning with streaming data has attracted much attention during the past few years.Though most studies consider data stream with fixed features; in real practice the features may be evolvable. For example; features of data gathered by limited lifespan sensors will change when these sensors are substituted by new ones. In this paper; we propose a novel learning paradigm: Feature Evolvable Streaming Learning where old features would vanish and new features would occur. Rather than relying on only the current features; we attempt to recover the vanished features and exploit it to improve performance. Specifically; we learn two models from the recovered features and the current features; respectively. To benefit from the recovered features; we develop two ensemble methods. In the first method; we combine the predictions from two models and theoretically show that with the assistance of old features; the performance on new features can be improved. In the second approach; we dynamically select the best single prediction and establish a better performance guarantee when the best model switches. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness of our proposal.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6740-learning-with-feature-evolvable-streams/bibtex,Bo-Jian Hou; Lijun Zhang; Zhi-Hua Zhou

However; most existing methods are built on least squares with the mean square error (MSE) criterion; which are sensitive to outliers and their performance may be degraded for heavy-tailed noise. In this paper; we go beyond this criterion by investigating the regularized modal regression from a statistical learning viewpoint. A new regularized modal regression model is proposed for estimation and variable selection; which is robust to outliers; heavy-tailed noise; and skewed noise. On the theoretical side; we establish the approximation estimate for learning the conditional mode function; the sparsity analysis for variable selection; and the robustness characterization. On the application side; we applied our model to successfully improve the cognitive impairment prediction using the Alzheimer?s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6743-regularized-modal-regression-with-applications-in-cognitive-impairment-prediction/bibtex,Xiaoqian Wang; Hong Chen; Weidong Cai; Dinggang Shen; Heng Huang
2017,Online Convex Optimization with Stochastic Constraints,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6741-online-convex-optimization-with-stochastic-constraints.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6741-online-convex-optimization-with-stochastic-constraints,This paper considers online convex optimization  (OCO) with stochastic constraints; which generalizes Zinkevich's OCO over a  known simple fixed set by introducing multiple stochastic functional constraints that are i.i.d. generated at each round and are disclosed to the decision maker only after the decision is made. This formulation arises naturally when decisions are restricted by stochastic environments or deterministic environments with noisy observations. It also includes many important problems  as special case; such as OCO with long term constraints; stochastic constrained convex optimization; and deterministic constrained convex optimization.  To solve this problem; this paper proposes a new algorithm that achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ expected regret and constraint violations and $O(\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ high probability regret and constraint violations. Experiments on a real-world data center scheduling problem further verify the performance of the new algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6741-online-convex-optimization-with-stochastic-constraints/bibtex,Hao Yu; Michael Neely; Xiaohan Wei

In particular; our bounds exploit nonbacktracking walks; Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Ginibre type inequalities; and are computed by message passing algorithms. Nonbacktracking walks have recently allowed for headways in community detection; and this paper shows that their use can also impact the influence computation. Further; we provide parameterized versions of the bounds that control the trade-off between the efficiency and the accuracy. Finally; the tightness of the bounds is illustrated with simulations on various network models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6739-nonbacktracking-bounds-on-the-influence-in-independent-cascade-models/bibtex,Emmanuel Abbe; Sanjeev Kulkarni; Eun Jee Lee

We show that while the ordinary Min-Sum algorithm does not converge; a modified version of it known as Splitting yields convergence to the problem solution. We prove that a proper choice of the tuning parameters allows Min-Sum Splitting to yield subdiffusive accelerated convergence rates; matching the rates obtained by shift-register methods. The acceleration scheme embodied by Min-Sum Splitting for the consensus problem bears similarities with lifted Markov chains techniques and with multi-step first order methods in convex optimization.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6736-accelerated-consensus-via-min-sum-splitting/bibtex,Patrick Rebeschini; Sekhar C.

2017,Adaptive stimulus selection for optimizing neural population responses,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6738-adaptive-stimulus-selection-for-optimizing-neural-population-responses.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6738-adaptive-stimulus-selection-for-optimizing-neural-population-responses,Adaptive stimulus selection methods in neuroscience have primarily focused on maximizing the firing rate of a single recorded neuron. When recording from a population of neurons; it is usually not possible to find a single stimulus that maximizes the firing rates of all neurons. This motivates optimizing an objective function that takes into account the responses of all recorded neurons together. We propose ?Adept;? an adaptive stimulus selection method that can optimize population objective functions. In simulations; we first confirmed that population objective functions elicited more diverse stimulus responses than single-neuron objective functions. Then; we tested Adept in a closed-loop electrophysiological experiment in which population activity was recorded from macaque V4; a cortical area known for mid-level visual processing. To predict neural responses; we used the outputs of a deep convolutional neural network model as feature embeddings. Images chosen by Adept elicited mean neural responses that were 20% larger than those for randomly-chosen natural images; and also evoked a larger diversity of neural responses. Such adaptive stimulus selection methods can facilitate experiments that involve neurons far from the sensory periphery; for which it is often unclear which stimuli to present.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6738-adaptive-stimulus-selection-for-optimizing-neural-population-responses/bibtex,Benjamin Cowley; Ryan Williamson; Katerina Clemens; Matthew Smith; Byron M.

2017,Generalized Linear Model Regression under Distance-to-set Penalties,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6737-generalized-linear-model-regression-under-distance-to-set-penalties.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6737-generalized-linear-model-regression-under-distance-to-set-penalties,Estimation in generalized linear models (GLM) is complicated by the presence of constraints. One can handle constraints by maximizing a penalized log-likelihood. Penalties such as the lasso are effective in high dimensions but often lead to severe shrinkage. This paper explores instead penalizing the squared distance to constraint sets. Distance penalties are more flexible than algebraic and regularization penalties; and avoid the drawback of shrinkage. To optimize distance penalized objectives; we make use of the majorization-minimization principle. Resulting algorithms constructed within this framework are amenable to acceleration and come with global convergence guarantees. Applications to shape constraints; sparse regression; and rank-restricted matrix regression on synthetic and real data showcase the strong empirical performance of distance penalization; even under non-convex constraints.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6737-generalized-linear-model-regression-under-distance-to-set-penalties/bibtex,Jason Xu; Eric Chi; Kenneth Lange
2017,Deanonymization in the Bitcoin P2P Network,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6735-deanonymization-in-the-bitcoin-p2p-network.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6735-deanonymization-in-the-bitcoin-p2p-network,Recent attacks on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) network demonstrated that its transaction-flooding protocols; which are used to ensure network consistency; may enable user deanonymization---the linkage of a user's IP address with her pseudonym in the Bitcoin network. In 2015; the Bitcoin community responded to these attacks by changing the network's flooding mechanism to a different protocol; known as diffusion. However; it is unclear if diffusion actually improves the system's anonymity. In this paper; we model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties; both pre- and post-2015. The core problem is one of epidemic source inference over graphs; where the observational model and spreading mechanisms are informed by Bitcoin's implementation; notably; these models have not been studied in the epidemic source detection literature before. We identify and analyze near-optimal source estimators. This analysis suggests that Bitcoin's networking protocols (both pre- and post-2015) offer poor anonymity properties on networks with a regular-tree topology. We confirm this claim in simulation on a 2015 snapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6735-deanonymization-in-the-bitcoin-p2p-network/bibtex,Giulia Fanti; Pramod Viswanath
2017,A Dirichlet Mixture Model of Hawkes Processes for Event Sequence Clustering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6734-a-dirichlet-mixture-model-of-hawkes-processes-for-event-sequence-clustering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6734-a-dirichlet-mixture-model-of-hawkes-processes-for-event-sequence-clustering,How to cluster event sequences generated via different point processes is an interesting and important problem in statistical machine learning.  To solve this problem; we propose and discuss an effective model-based clustering method based on a novel Dirichlet mixture model of a special but significant type of point processes --- Hawkes process.  The proposed model generates the event sequences with different clusters from the Hawkes processes with different parameters; and uses a Dirichlet process as the prior distribution of the clusters.  We prove the identifiability of our mixture model and propose an effective variational Bayesian inference algorithm to learn our model.  An adaptive inner iteration allocation strategy is designed to accelerate the convergence of our algorithm. Moreover; we investigate the sample complexity and the computational complexity  of our learning algorithm in depth.  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the clustering method based on our model can learn structural triggering patterns hidden in asynchronous event sequences robustly and achieve superior performance on clustering purity and consistency compared to existing methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6734-a-dirichlet-mixture-model-of-hawkes-processes-for-event-sequence-clustering/bibtex,Hongteng Xu; Hongyuan Zha

However; it is rarely that all possible differences between samples are of interest -- discovered differences can be due to different types of measurement noise; data collection artefacts or other irrelevant sources of variability. We propose distances between distributions which encode invariance to additive symmetric noise; aimed at testing whether the assumed true underlying processes differ. Moreover; we construct invariant features of distributions; leading to learning algorithms robust to the impairment of the input distributions with symmetric additive noise.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6733-testing-and-learning-on-distributions-with-symmetric-noise-invariance/bibtex,Ho Chung Law; Christopher Yau; Dino Sejdinovic
2017,Learning Unknown Markov Decision Processes: A Thompson Sampling Approach,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6732-learning-unknown-markov-decision-processes-a-thompson-sampling-approach.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6732-learning-unknown-markov-decision-processes-a-thompson-sampling-approach,We consider the problem of learning an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP) that is weakly communicating in the infinite horizon setting. We propose a Thompson Sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm with dynamic episodes (TSDE). At the beginning of each episode; the algorithm generates a sample from the posterior distribution over the unknown model parameters. It then follows the optimal stationary policy for the sampled model for the rest of the episode. The duration of each episode is dynamically determined by two stopping criteria. The first stopping criterion controls the growth rate of episode length. The second stopping criterion happens when the number of visits to any state-action pair is doubled. We establish $\tilde O(HS\sqrt{AT})$ bounds on expected regret under a Bayesian setting; where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces; $T$ is time; and $H$ is the bound of the span. This regret bound matches the best available bound for weakly communicating MDPs. Numerical results show it to perform better than existing algorithms for infinite horizon MDPs.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6732-learning-unknown-markov-decision-processes-a-thompson-sampling-approach/bibtex,Yi Ouyang; Mukul Gagrani; Ashutosh Nayyar; Rahul Jain
2017,DPSCREEN: Dynamic Personalized Screening,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6731-dpscreen-dynamic-personalized-screening.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6731-dpscreen-dynamic-personalized-screening,Screening is important for the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of diseases.  A good screening  policy should be personalized to the disease; to the features of the patient and to the dynamic history of the patient (including the history of screening).  The growth of electronic health records data  has led to the development of many  models to  predict the onset and progression of different diseases. However; there has been limited work to address the personalized screening for these different diseases. In this work; we develop the first framework to construct screening policies for a large class of disease models. The disease is modeled as a finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state. The patient observes an  external information process (for instance; self-examinations; discovering comorbidities; etc.) which can trigger the patient to arrive at the clinician earlier than scheduled screenings. The clinician carries out the tests; based on the test results and the  external information it schedules the next arrival.  Computing the exactly optimal screening policy that balances the delay in the detection against the frequency of screenings is computationally intractable; this paper provides a computationally tractable construction of an approximately optimal policy.  As an illustration; we make use of a large breast cancer data set.  The constructed policy screens patients more or less often according to their initial risk -- it is personalized to the features of the patient -- and according to the results of previous screens ? it is personalized to the  history of the patient. In comparison with existing clinical policies; the constructed policy leads to large reductions (28-68 %) in the number of screens performed while achieving the same expected delays in disease detection.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6731-dpscreen-dynamic-personalized-screening/bibtex,Kartik Ahuja; William Zame; Mihaela van der Schaar

This type of data can be represented as a three dimensional individual/feature/time tensor and has become increasingly prominent in various areas of science. The tensor biclustering problem computes a subset of individuals and a subset of features whose signal trajectories over time lie in a low-dimensional subspace; modeling similarity among the signal trajectories while allowing different scalings across different individuals or different features. We study the information-theoretic limit of this problem under a generative model. Moreover; we propose an efficient spectral algorithm to solve the tensor biclustering problem and analyze its achievability bound in an asymptotic regime. Finally; we show the efficiency of our proposed method in several synthetic and real datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6730-tensor-biclustering/bibtex,Soheil Feizi; Hamid Javadi; David Tse

This paper makes three main contributions.  First; it defines a model to reason formally about settings with selfish experts; and demonstrates that  ``incentive compatible'' (IC) algorithms are closely related to the design of proper scoring rules.   Second; we design IC algorithms with good performance guarantees for the absolute loss function. Third; we give a formal separation between the power of online prediction with selfish experts and online prediction with honest experts by proving lower bounds for both IC and non-IC algorithms.  In particular; with selfish experts and the absolute loss function; there is no (randomized) algorithm for online prediction---IC or otherwise---with asymptotically vanishing regret.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6729-online-prediction-with-selfish-experts/bibtex,Tim Roughgarden; Okke Schrijvers

In this paper; we build machines to approximate such competency. We first mimic human knowledge of the physical world by building an efficient; physics-based simulation engine. Then; we present an analysis-by-synthesis approach to infer properties of the falling object. We further accelerate the process by learning a mapping from a sound wave to object properties; and using the predicted values to initialize the inference. This mapping can be viewed as an approximation of human commonsense learned from past experience. Our model performs well on both synthetic audio clips and real recordings without requiring any annotated data. We conduct behavior studies to compare human responses with ours on estimating object shape; material; and falling height from sound. Our model achieves near-human performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6727-shape-and-material-from-sound/bibtex,Zhoutong Zhang; Qiujia Li; Zhengjia Huang; Jiajun Wu; Josh Tenenbaum; Bill Freeman
2017,Flexible statistical inference for mechanistic models of neural dynamics,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6728-flexible-statistical-inference-for-mechanistic-models-of-neural-dynamics.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6728-flexible-statistical-inference-for-mechanistic-models-of-neural-dynamics,Mechanistic models of single-neuron dynamics have been extensively studied in computational neuroscience. However; identifying which models can quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation; ABC) to perform full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore; we propose an efficient approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the simulator fails; as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data; our approach efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages; we recover multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters; which yield model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms; closing the gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6728-flexible-statistical-inference-for-mechanistic-models-of-neural-dynamics/bibtex,Jan-Matthis Lueckmann; Pedro J.

2017,Adaptive Bayesian Sampling with Monte Carlo EM,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6725-adaptive-bayesian-sampling-with-monte-carlo-em.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6725-adaptive-bayesian-sampling-with-monte-carlo-em,We present a novel technique for learning the mass matrices in samplers obtained from discretized dynamics that preserve some energy function. Existing adaptive samplers use Riemannian preconditioning techniques; where the mass matrices are functions of the parameters being sampled. This leads to significant complexities in the energy reformulations and resultant dynamics; often leading to implicit systems of equations and requiring inversion of high-dimensional matrices in the leapfrog steps. Our approach provides a simpler alternative; by using existing dynamics in the sampling step of a Monte Carlo EM framework; and learning the mass matrices in the M step with a novel online technique. We also propose a way to adaptively set the number of samples gathered in the E step; using sampling error estimates from the leapfrog dynamics. Along with a novel stochastic sampler based on Nos\'{e}-Poincar\'{e} dynamics; we use this framework with standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as well as newer stochastic algorithms such as SGHMC and SGNHT; and show strong performance on synthetic and real high-dimensional sampling scenarios; we achieve sampling accuracies comparable to Riemannian samplers while being significantly faster.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6725-adaptive-bayesian-sampling-with-monte-carlo-em/bibtex,Anirban Roychowdhury; Srinivasan Parthasarathy
2017,ADMM without a Fixed Penalty Parameter: Faster Convergence with New Adaptive Penalization,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6726-admm-without-a-fixed-penalty-parameter-faster-convergence-with-new-adaptive-penalization.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6726-admm-without-a-fixed-penalty-parameter-faster-convergence-with-new-adaptive-penalization,Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has received tremendous interest for solving numerous  problems in machine learning; statistics and signal processing. However; it is known that the performance of ADMM and many of its variants is very sensitive to the penalty parameter of a quadratic penalty applied to the equality constraints. Although several approaches have been proposed for dynamically changing this parameter during the course of optimization; they do not yield theoretical improvement in the convergence rate and are not directly applicable to stochastic ADMM. In this paper; we develop a new ADMM and its linearized variant with a new adaptive scheme to update the penalty parameter. Our methods can be applied under both deterministic and stochastic optimization settings for structured non-smooth objective function. The novelty of the proposed scheme lies at that it is adaptive to a local sharpness property of the objective function; which marks the key difference from previous adaptive scheme that adjusts the penalty parameter per-iteration based on certain conditions on iterates. On theoretical side; given the local sharpness characterized by an exponent $\theta\in(0; 1]$;  we show that the proposed ADMM enjoys an improved iteration complexity of $\widetilde O(1/\epsilon^{1-\theta})$\footnote{$\widetilde O()$ suppresses a logarithmic factor.} in the deterministic setting and an iteration complexity of $\widetilde O(1/\epsilon^{2(1-\theta)})$ in the stochastic setting without smoothness and strong convexity assumptions. The complexity in either setting improves that of the standard ADMM which only uses a fixed penalty parameter. On the practical side; we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms converge comparably to; if not much faster than; ADMM with a fine-tuned fixed penalty parameter.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6726-admm-without-a-fixed-penalty-parameter-faster-convergence-with-new-adaptive-penalization/bibtex,Yi Xu; Mingrui Liu; Qihang Lin; Tianbao Yang

The requirement of structured and isolated demonstrations limits the scalability of imitation learning approaches as they are difficult to apply to real-world scenarios; where robots have to be able to execute a multitude of tasks. In this paper; we propose a multi-modal imitation learning framework that is able to segment and imitate skills from unlabelled and unstructured demonstrations by learning skill segmentation and imitation learning jointly. The extensive simulation results indicate that our method can efficiently separate the demonstrations into individual skills and learn to imitate them using a single multi-modal policy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6723-multi-modal-imitation-learning-from-unstructured-demonstrations-using-generative-adversarial-nets/bibtex,Karol Hausman; Yevgen Chebotar; Stefan Schaal; Gaurav Sukhatme; Joseph J.

We present two architectural recipes in the context of multi-stage progressive encoders  and empirically demonstrate their importance on compression performance. Specifically; we show that: 1) predicting the original image data from residuals in a multi-stage progressive architecture facilitates learning and leads to improved performance at approximating the original content and 2) learning to inpaint (from neighboring image pixels) before performing compression reduces the amount of information that must be stored to achieve a high-quality approximation. Incorporating these design choices in a baseline progressive encoder yields an average reduction of over 60% in file size with similar quality compared to the original residual encoder.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6724-learning-to-inpaint-for-image-compression/bibtex,Mohammad Haris Baig; Vladlen Koltun; Lorenzo Torresani

Because of storage limitations; it may only be possible to retain a sketch of the psd matrix. This paper develops a new algorithm for fixed-rank psd approximation from a sketch. The approach combines the Nystr?m approximation with a novel mechanism for rank truncation. Theoretical analysis establishes that the proposed method can achieve any prescribed relative error in the Schatten 1-norm and that it exploits the spectral decay of the input matrix.  Computer experiments show that the proposed method dominates alternative techniques for fixed-rank psd matrix approximation across a wide range of examples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6722-fixed-rank-approximation-of-a-positive-semidefinite-matrix-from-streaming-data/bibtex,Joel A.

We resolve a serious issue in the prior CMAB-T studies where the regret bounds contain a possibly exponentially large factor of 1/p*; where p* is the minimum positive probability that an arm is triggered by any action. We address this issue by introducing a triggering probability modulated (TPM) bounded smoothness condition into the influence maximization bandit and combinatorial cascading bandit satisfy this TPM condition. As a result; we completely remove the factor of 1/p* from the regret bounds; achieving significantly better regret bounds for influence maximization and cascading bandits than before. Finally; we provide lower bound results showing that the factor 1/p* is unavoidable for general CMAB-T problems; suggesting that the TPM condition is crucial in removing this factor.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6716-improving-regret-bounds-for-combinatorial-semi-bandits-with-probabilistically-triggered-arms-and-its-applications/bibtex,Qinshi Wang; Wei Chen
2017,Mean teachers are better role models: Weight-averaged consistency targets improve semi-supervised deep learning results,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6719-mean-teachers-are-better-role-models-weight-averaged-consistency-targets-improve-semi-supervised-deep-learning-results.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6719-mean-teachers-are-better-role-models-weight-averaged-consistency-targets-improve-semi-supervised-deep-learning-results,The recently proposed Temporal Ensembling has achieved state-of-the-art results in several semi-supervised learning benchmarks. It maintains an exponential moving average of label predictions on each training example; and penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with this target. However; because the targets change only once per epoch; Temporal Ensembling becomes unwieldy when learning large datasets. To overcome this problem; we propose Mean Teacher; a method that averages model weights instead of label predictions. As an additional benefit; Mean Teacher improves test accuracy and enables training with fewer labels than Temporal Ensembling. Without changing the network architecture; Mean Teacher achieves an error rate of 4.35% on SVHN with 250 labels; outperforming Temporal Ensembling trained with 1000 labels. We also show that a good network architecture is crucial to performance. Combining Mean Teacher and Residual Networks; we improve the state of the art on CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels from 10.55% to 6.28%; and on ImageNet 2012 with 10% of the labels from 35.24% to 9.11%.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6719-mean-teachers-are-better-role-models-weight-averaged-consistency-targets-improve-semi-supervised-deep-learning-results/bibtex,Antti Tarvainen; Harri Valpola

By modelling the target function as a transformation of an underlying function; the constraints are explicitly incorporated in the model such that they are guaranteed to be fulfilled by any sample drawn or prediction made. We also propose a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and illustrate the result on both simulated and real-data examples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6721-linearly-constrained-gaussian-processes/bibtex,Carl Jidling; Niklas Wahlstr?m; Adrian Wills; Thomas B.

2017,Matching neural paths: transfer from recognition to correspondence search,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6720-matching-neural-paths-transfer-from-recognition-to-correspondence-search.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6720-matching-neural-paths-transfer-from-recognition-to-correspondence-search,Many machine learning tasks require finding per-part correspondences between objects. In this work we focus on low-level correspondences --- a highly ambiguous matching problem. We propose to use a hierarchical semantic representation of the objects; coming from a convolutional neural network; to solve this ambiguity. Training it for low-level correspondence prediction directly might not be an option in some domains where the ground-truth correspondences are hard to obtain. We show how transfer from recognition can be used to avoid such training. Our idea is to mark parts as "matching" if their features are close to each other at all the levels of convolutional feature hierarchy (neural paths). Although the overall number of such paths is exponential in the number of layers; we propose a polynomial algorithm for aggregating all of them in a single backward pass. The empirical validation is done on the task of stereo correspondence and demonstrates that we achieve competitive results among the methods which do not use labeled target domain data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6720-matching-neural-paths-transfer-from-recognition-to-correspondence-search/bibtex,Nikolay Savinov; Lubor Ladicky; Marc Pollefeys

Our main result is a high probability regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(D\sqrt{SAT})$ for any communicating MDP with $S$ states; $A$ actions and diameter $D$; when $T\ge S^5A$. Here; regret compares the total reward achieved by the algorithm to the total expected reward of an optimal infinite-horizon undiscounted average reward policy; in time horizon $T$. This result improves over the best previously known upper bound of $\tilde{O}(DS\sqrt{AT})$ achieved by any algorithm in this setting; and matches the dependence on $S$ in the established lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{DSAT})$ for this problem. Our techniques involve proving some novel results about the anti-concentration of Dirichlet distribution; which may be of independent interest.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6718-optimistic-posterior-sampling-for-reinforcement-learning-worst-case-regret-bounds/bibtex,Shipra Agrawal; Randy Jia
2017,Predictive-State Decoders: Encoding the Future into Recurrent Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6717-predictive-state-decoders-encoding-the-future-into-recurrent-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6717-predictive-state-decoders-encoding-the-future-into-recurrent-networks,Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a vital modeling technique that rely on internal states learned indirectly by optimization of a supervised; unsupervised; or reinforcement training loss. RNNs are used to model dynamic processes that are characterized by underlying latent states whose form is often unknown; precluding its analytic representation inside an RNN. In the Predictive-State Representation (PSR) literature; latent state processes are modeled by an internal state representation that directly models the distribution of future observations; and most recent work in this area has relied on explicitly representing and targeting sufficient statistics of this probability distribution. We seek to combine the advantages of RNNs and PSRs by augmenting existing state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks with Predictive-State Decoders (PSDs); which add supervision to the network's internal state representation to target predicting future observations. PSDs are simple to implement and easily incorporated into existing training pipelines via additional loss regularization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PSDs with experimental results in three different domains:  probabilistic filtering; Imitation Learning; and Reinforcement Learning. In each; our method improves statistical performance of state-of-the-art recurrent baselines and does so with fewer iterations and less data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6717-predictive-state-decoders-encoding-the-future-into-recurrent-networks/bibtex,Arun Venkatraman; Nicholas Rhinehart; Wen Sun; Lerrel Pinto; Martial Hebert; Byron Boots; Kris Kitani; J.

This model falls into the well defined mixed-effect models. The subject-specific trajectories are defined through spatial and temporal transformations of the group-average piecewise-geodesic path; component by component. Thus we can apply our model to a wide variety of situations. Due to the non-linearity of the model; we use the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. Experiments on synthetic data validate this choice. The model is then applied to the metastatic renal cancer chemotherapy monitoring: we run estimations on RECIST scores of treated patients and estimate the time they escape from the treatment. Experiments highlight the role of the different parameters on the response to treatment.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6715-learning-spatiotemporal-piecewise-geodesic-trajectories-from-longitudinal-manifold-valued-data/bibtex,St?phanie ALLASSONNIERE; Juliette Chevallier; Stephane Oudard

Our method is based on a soft (continuous) relaxation of quantization and entropy; which we anneal to their discrete counterparts throughout training.  We showcase this method for two challenging applications: Image compression and neural network compression.  While these tasks have typically been approached with different methods; our soft-to-hard quantization approach gives results competitive with the state-of-the-art for both.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6714-soft-to-hard-vector-quantization-for-end-to-end-learning-compressible-representations/bibtex,Eirikur Agustsson; Fabian Mentzer; Michael Tschannen; Lukas Cavigelli; Radu Timofte; Luca Benini; Luc V.

Dynamic mode decomposition is a popular numerical algorithm for Koopman spectral analysis; however; we often need to prepare nonlinear observables manually according to the underlying dynamics; which is not always possible since we may not have any a priori knowledge about them. In this paper; we propose a fully data-driven method for Koopman spectral analysis based on the principle of learning Koopman invariant subspaces from observed data. To this end; we propose minimization of the residual sum of squares of linear least-squares regression to estimate a set of functions that transforms data into a form in which the linear regression fits well. We introduce an implementation with neural networks and evaluate performance empirically using nonlinear dynamical systems and applications.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6713-learning-koopman-invariant-subspaces-for-dynamic-mode-decomposition/bibtex,Naoya Takeishi; Yoshinobu Kawahara; Takehisa Yairi

Here; we clarify results of \citet{Nemi85} who show that H\"olderian error bounds directly controls the performance of restart schemes. The constants quantifying error bounds are of course unobservable; but we show that optimal restart strategies are robust; and searching for the best scheme only increases the complexity by a logarithmic factor compared to the optimal bound. Overall then; restart schemes generically accelerate accelerated methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6712-sharpness-restart-and-acceleration/bibtex,Vincent Roulet; Alexandre d'Aspremont

Compared with recent advances in this vein; the differential equation considered here is the basic gradient flow; and we derive a class of multi-step schemes which includes accelerated algorithms; using classical conditions from numerical analysis.

In this work; we propose an efficient Perceptron-based algorithm for actively learning homogeneous halfspaces under the uniform distribution over the unit sphere. Under the bounded noise condition~\cite{MN06}; where each label is flipped with probability at most $\eta < \frac 1 2$; our algorithm achieves a near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{(1-2\eta)^2}\ln\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ in time $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{\epsilon(1-2\eta)^3}\right)$. Under the adversarial noise condition~\cite{ABL14; KLS09; KKMS08}; where at most a $\tilde \Omega(\epsilon)$ fraction of labels can be flipped; our algorithm achieves a near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(d\ln\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ in time $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{\epsilon}\right)$. Furthermore; we show that our active learning algorithm can be converted to an efficient passive learning algorithm that has near-optimal sample complexities with respect to $\epsilon$ and $d$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6706-revisiting-perceptron-efficient-and-label-optimal-learning-of-halfspaces/bibtex,Songbai Yan; Chicheng Zhang

One of the goals for analyzing such data is hence to extract such `shift-invariant' atoms. Even though some success has been reported with existing algorithms; they are limited in applicability due to their heuristic nature. Moreover; they are often vulnerable to artifacts and impulsive noise; which are typically present in raw neural recordings. In this study; we address these issues and propose a novel probabilistic convolutional sparse coding (CSC) model for learning shift-invariant atoms from raw neural signals containing potentially severe artifacts. In the core of our model; which we call $\alpha$CSC; lies a family of heavy-tailed distributions called $\alpha$-stable distributions. We develop a novel; computationally efficient Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm for inference. The maximization step boils down to a weighted CSC problem; for which we  develop a computationally efficient optimization algorithm. Our results show that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art convergence speeds. Besides; $\alpha$CSC is significantly more robust to artifacts when compared to three competing algorithms: it can extract spike bursts; oscillations; and even reveal more subtle phenomena such as cross-frequency coupling when applied to noisy neural time series.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6710-learning-the-morphology-of-brain-signals-using-alpha-stable-convolutional-sparse-coding/bibtex,Mainak Jas; Tom Dupr? la Tour; Umut Simsekli; Alexandre Gramfort
2017,Union of Intersections (UoI) for Interpretable Data Driven Discovery and Prediction,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6708-union-of-intersections-uoi-for-interpretable-data-driven-discovery-and-prediction.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6708-union-of-intersections-uoi-for-interpretable-data-driven-discovery-and-prediction,The increasing size and complexity of scientific data could dramatically enhance discovery and prediction for basic scientific applications; e.g.; neuroscience; genetics; systems biology; etc. Realizing this potential; however; requires novel statistical analysis methods that are both interpretable and predictive. We introduce the Union of Intersections (UoI) method; a flexible; modular; and scalable framework for enhanced model selection and estimation. The method performs model selection and model estimation through intersection and union operations; respectively. We show that UoI can satisfy the bi-criteria of low-variance and nearly unbiased estimation of a small number of interpretable features; while maintaining high-quality prediction accuracy. We perform extensive numerical investigation to evaluate a UoI algorithm ($UoI_{Lasso}$) on synthetic and real data. In doing so; we demonstrate the extraction of interpretable functional networks from human electrophysiology recordings as well as the accurate prediction of phenotypes from genotype-phenotype data with reduced features. We also show (with the $UoI_{L1Logistic}$ and $UoI_{CUR}$ variants of the basic framework) improved prediction parsimony for classification and matrix factorization on several benchmark biomedical data sets. These results suggest that methods based on UoI framework could improve interpretation and prediction in data-driven discovery across scientific fields.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6708-union-of-intersections-uoi-for-interpretable-data-driven-discovery-and-prediction/bibtex,Kristofer Bouchard; Alejandro Bujan; Farbod Roosta-Khorasani; Shashanka Ubaru; Mr. Prabhat; Antoine Snijders; Jian-Hua Mao; Edward Chang; Michael W.

Here we introduce a cognitive model capable of constructing human-like questions. Our approach treats questions as formal programs that; when executed on the state of the world; output an answer. The model specifies a probability distribution over a complex; compositional space of programs; favoring concise programs that help the agent learn in the current context. We evaluate our approach by modeling the types of open-ended questions generated by humans who were attempting to learn about an ambiguous situation in a game. We find that our model predicts what questions people will ask; and can creatively produce novel questions that were not present in the training set. In addition; we compare a number of model variants; finding that both question informativeness and complexity are important for producing human-like questions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6705-question-asking-as-program-generation/bibtex,Anselm Rothe; Brenden M.

On the other hand; gradient descent with perturbations [Ge et al.; 2015; Jin et al.; 2017] is not slowed down by saddle points?it can find an approximate local minimizer in polynomial time. This result implies that GD is inherently slower than perturbed GD; and justifies the importance of adding perturbations for efficient non-convex optimization. While our focus is theoretical; we also present experiments that illustrate our theoretical findings.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6707-gradient-descent-can-take-exponential-time-to-escape-saddle-points/bibtex,Simon S.

2017,One-Shot Imitation Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6709-one-shot-imitation-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6709-one-shot-imitation-learning,Imitation learning has been commonly applied to solve different tasks in isolation. This usually requires either careful feature engineering; or a significant number of samples. This is far from what we desire: ideally; robots should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task; and instantly generalize to new situations of the same task; without requiring task-specific engineering. In this paper; we propose a meta-learning framework for achieving such capability; which we call one-shot imitation learning.  Specifically; we consider the setting where there is a very large (maybe infinite) set of tasks; and each task has many instantiations.  For example; a task could be to stack all blocks on a table into a single tower; another task could be to place all blocks on a table into two-block towers; etc. In each case; different instances of the task would consist of different sets of blocks with different initial states.  At training time; our algorithm is presented with pairs of demonstrations for a subset of all tasks.  A neural net is trained that takes as input one demonstration and the current state (which initially is the initial state of the other demonstration of the pair); and outputs an action with the goal that the resulting sequence of states and actions matches as closely as possible with the second demonstration. At test time; a demonstration of a single instance of a new task is presented; and the neural net is expected to perform well on new instances of this new task. Our experiments show that the use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to conditions and tasks unseen in the training data. We anticipate that by training this model on a much greater variety of tasks and settings; we will obtain a general system that can turn any demonstrations into robust policies that can accomplish an overwhelming variety of tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6709-one-shot-imitation-learning/bibtex,Yan Duan; Marcin Andrychowicz; Bradly Stadie; OpenAI Jonathan Ho; Jonas Schneider; Ilya Sutskever; Pieter Abbeel; Wojciech Zaremba
2017,Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6703-inductive-representation-learning-on-large-graphs.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6703-inductive-representation-learning-on-large-graphs,Low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large graphs have proved extremely useful in a variety of prediction tasks; from content recommendation to identifying protein functions. However; most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE; a general; inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g.; text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings.  Instead of training individual embeddings for each node; we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data; and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6703-inductive-representation-learning-on-large-graphs/bibtex,Will Hamilton; Zhitao Ying; Jure Leskovec
2017,Self-Normalizing Neural Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6698-self-normalizing-neural-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6698-self-normalizing-neural-networks,Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However; success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and; therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization; neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs); which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem; we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers; (2) employ strong regularization; and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore; for activations not close to unit variance; we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance; thus; vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository; on (b) drug discovery benchmarks; and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. For FNNs we considered (i) ReLU networks without normalization; (ii) batch normalization; (iii) layer normalization; (iv) weight normalization; (v) highway networks; (vi) residual networks. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks; outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset; and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6698-self-normalizing-neural-networks/bibtex,G?nter Klambauer; Thomas Unterthiner; Andreas Mayr; Sepp Hochreiter
2017,GP CaKe: Effective brain connectivity with causal kernels,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6696-gp-cake-effective-brain-connectivity-with-causal-kernels.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6696-gp-cake-effective-brain-connectivity-with-causal-kernels,A fundamental goal in network neuroscience is to understand how activity in one brain region drives activity elsewhere; a process referred to as effective connectivity. Here we propose to model this causal interaction using integro-differential equations and causal kernels that allow for a rich analysis of effective connectivity. The approach combines the tractability and flexibility of autoregressive modeling with the biophysical interpretability of dynamic causal modeling. The causal kernels are learned nonparametrically using Gaussian process regression; yielding an efficient framework for causal inference. We construct a novel class of causal covariance functions that enforce the desired properties of the causal kernels; an approach which we call GP CaKe. By construction; the model and its hyperparameters have biophysical meaning and are therefore easily interpretable. We demonstrate the efficacy of GP CaKe on a number of simulations and give an example of a realistic application on magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6696-gp-cake-effective-brain-connectivity-with-causal-kernels/bibtex,Luca Ambrogioni; Max Hinne; Marcel Van Gerven; Eric Maris

Sequential data; including time-series and ordered data; contain important structural relationships among items; imposed by underlying dynamic models of data; that should play a vital role in the selection of representatives. However; nearly all existing subset selection techniques ignore underlying dynamics of data and treat items independently; leading to incompatible sets of representatives. In this paper; we develop a new framework for sequential subset selection that finds a set of representatives compatible with the dynamic models of data. To do so; we equip items with transition dynamic models and pose the problem as an integer binary optimization over assignments of sequential items to representatives; that leads to high encoding; diversity and transition potentials. Our formulation generalizes the well-known facility location objective to deal with sequential data; incorporating transition dynamics among facilities. As the proposed formulation is non-convex; we derive a max-sum message passing algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. Experiments on synthetic and real data; including instructional video summarization; show that our sequential subset selection framework not only achieves better encoding and diversity than the state of the art; but also successfully incorporates dynamics of data; leading to compatible representatives.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6704-subset-selection-and-summarization-in-sequential-data/bibtex,Ehsan Elhamifar; M.

2017,Matching on Balanced Nonlinear Representations for Treatment Effects Estimation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6694-matching-on-balanced-nonlinear-representations-for-treatment-effects-estimation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6694-matching-on-balanced-nonlinear-representations-for-treatment-effects-estimation,Estimating treatment effects from observational data is challenging due to the missing counterfactuals. Matching is an effective strategy to tackle this problem. The widely used matching estimators such as nearest neighbor matching (NNM) pair the treated units with the most similar control units in terms of covariates; and then estimate treatment effects accordingly. However; the existing matching estimators have poor performance when the distributions of control and treatment groups are unbalanced. Moreover; theoretical analysis suggests that the bias of causal effect estimation would increase with the dimension of covariates. In this paper; we aim to address these problems by learning low-dimensional balanced and nonlinear representations (BNR) for observational data. In particular; we convert counterfactual prediction as a classification problem; develop a kernel learning model with domain adaptation constraint; and design a novel matching estimator. The dimension of covariates will be significantly reduced after projecting data to a low-dimensional subspace. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6694-matching-on-balanced-nonlinear-representations-for-treatment-effects-estimation/bibtex,Sheng Li; Yun Fu

While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images; audio and video data; the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead; their precise locations contain essential physical information; that would get lost if discretized. Thus; we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories.

A useful approach to obtain data is to  be creative and mine data from various sources; that were created for different purposes. Unfortunately; this approach often leads to noisy labels. In this paper; we propose a meta algorithm for tackling the noisy labels problem. The key idea is to decouple  ``when to update'' from ``how to update''. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by mining data for gender classification by combining the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) face recognition dataset with a textual genderizing service; which leads to a noisy dataset. While our approach is very simple to implement; it leads to state-of-the-art results. We analyze some convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6697-decoupling-when-to-update-from-how-to-update/bibtex,Eran Malach; Shai Shalev-Shwartz
2017,Differentiable Learning of Submodular Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6702-differentiable-learning-of-submodular-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6702-differentiable-learning-of-submodular-models,Can we incorporate discrete optimization algorithms within modern machine learning models? For example; is it possible to use in deep architectures a layer whose output is the minimal cut of a parametrized graph? Given that these models are trained end-to-end by leveraging gradient information; the introduction of such layers seems very challenging due to their non-continuous output. In this paper we focus on the problem of submodular minimization; for which we show that such layers are indeed possible. The key idea is that we can continuously relax the output without sacrificing guarantees. We provide an easily computable approximation to the Jacobian complemented with a complete theoretical analysis. Finally; these contributions let us experimentally learn probabilistic log-supermodular models via a bi-level variational inference formulation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6702-differentiable-learning-of-submodular-models/bibtex,Josip Djolonga; Andreas Krause
2017,Learning to Pivot with Adversarial Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6699-learning-to-pivot-with-adversarial-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6699-learning-to-pivot-with-adversarial-networks,Several techniques for domain adaptation have been proposed to account for differences in the distribution of the data used for training and testing. The majority of this work focuses on a binary domain label. Similar problems occur in a scientific context where there may be a continuous family of plausible data generation processes associated to the presence of systematic uncertainties. Robust inference is possible if it is based on a pivot -- a quantity whose distribution does not depend on the unknown values of the nuisance parameters that parametrize this family of data generation processes. In this work;  we introduce and derive theoretical results for a training procedure based on adversarial networks for enforcing the pivotal property (or; equivalently; fairness with respect to continuous attributes) on a predictive model. The method includes a hyperparameter to control the trade-off between accuracy and robustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with a toy example and examples from particle physics.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6699-learning-to-pivot-with-adversarial-networks/bibtex,Gilles Louppe; Michael Kagan; Kyle Cranmer
2017,Learning Overcomplete HMMs,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6695-learning-overcomplete-hmms.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6695-learning-overcomplete-hmms,We study the basic problem of learning overcomplete HMMs---those that have many hidden states but a small output alphabet. Despite having significant practical importance; such HMMs are poorly understood with no known positive or negative results for efficient learning. In this paper; we present several new results---both positive and negative---which help define the boundaries between the tractable-learning setting and the intractable setting. We show positive results for a large subclass of HMMs whose transition matrices are sparse; well-conditioned and have small probability mass on short cycles. We also show that learning is impossible given only a polynomial number of samples for HMMs with a small output alphabet and whose transition matrices are random regular graphs with large degree. We also discuss these results in the context of learning HMMs which can capture long-term dependencies.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6695-learning-overcomplete-hmms/bibtex,Vatsal Sharan; Sham M.

2017,Online multiclass boosting,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6693-online-multiclass-boosting.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6693-online-multiclass-boosting,Recent work has extended the theoretical analysis of boosting algorithms to multiclass problems and to online settings. However; the multiclass extension is in the batch setting and the online extensions only consider binary classification. We fill this gap in the literature by defining; and justifying; a weak learning condition for online multiclass boosting. This condition leads to an optimal boosting algorithm that requires the minimal number of weak learners to achieve a certain accuracy. Additionally; we propose an adaptive algorithm which is near optimal and enjoys an excellent performance on real data due to its adaptive property.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6693-online-multiclass-boosting/bibtex,Young Hun Jung; Jack Goetz; Ambuj Tewari
2017,Contrastive Learning for Image Captioning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6691-contrastive-learning-for-image-captioning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6691-contrastive-learning-for-image-captioning,Image captioning; a popular topic in computer vision; has achieved substantial progress in recent years. However; the distinctiveness of natural descriptions is often overlooked in previous work. It is closely related to the quality of captions; as distinctive captions are more likely to describe images with their unique aspects. In this work; we propose a new learning method; Contrastive Learning (CL); for image captioning. Specifically; via two constraints formulated on top of a reference model; the proposed method can encourage distinctiveness; while maintaining the overall quality of the generated captions. We tested our method on two challenging datasets; where it improves the baseline model by significant margins. We also showed in our studies that the proposed method is generic and can be used for models with various structures.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6691-contrastive-learning-for-image-captioning/bibtex,Bo Dai; Dahua Lin
2017,Label Distribution Learning Forests,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6685-label-distribution-learning-forests.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6685-label-distribution-learning-forests,Label distribution learning (LDL) is a general learning framework; which assigns to an instance a distribution over a set of labels rather than a single label or multiple labels. Current LDL methods have either restricted assumptions on the expression form of the label distribution or limitations in representation learning; e.g.; to learn deep features in an end-to-end manner. This paper presents label distribution learning forests (LDLFs) - a novel label distribution learning algorithm based on differentiable decision trees; which have several advantages: 1) Decision trees have the potential to model any general form of label distributions by a mixture of leaf node predictions. 2) The learning of differentiable decision trees can be combined with representation learning. We define a distribution-based loss function for a forest; enabling all the trees to be learned jointly; and show that an update function for leaf node predictions; which guarantees a strict decrease of the loss function; can be derived by variational bounding. The effectiveness of the proposed LDLFs is verified on several LDL tasks and a computer vision application; showing significant improvements to the state-of-the-art LDL methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6685-label-distribution-learning-forests/bibtex,Wei Shen; KAI ZHAO; Yilu Guo; Alan L.

This paper models these structures by presenting a predictive recurrent neural network (PredRNN). This architecture is enlightened by the idea that spatiotemporal predictive learning should memorize both spatial appearances and temporal variations in a unified memory pool. Concretely; memory states are no longer constrained inside each LSTM unit. Instead; they are allowed to zigzag in two directions: across stacked RNN layers vertically and through all RNN states horizontally. The core of this network is a new Spatiotemporal LSTM (ST-LSTM) unit that extracts and memorizes spatial and temporal  representations simultaneously. PredRNN achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance on three video prediction datasets and is a more general framework; that can be easily extended to other predictive learning tasks by integrating with other architectures.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6689-predrnn-recurrent-neural-networks-for-predictive-learning-using-spatiotemporal-lstms/bibtex,Yunbo Wang; Mingsheng Long; Jianmin Wang; Zhifeng Gao; Philip S.

2017,Multiscale Semi-Markov Dynamics for Intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6688-multiscale-semi-markov-dynamics-for-intracortical-brain-computer-interfaces.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6688-multiscale-semi-markov-dynamics-for-intracortical-brain-computer-interfaces,Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have allowed people with tetraplegia to control a computer cursor by imagining the movement of their paralyzed arm or hand. State-of-the-art decoders deployed in human iBCIs are derived from a Kalman filter that assumes Markov dynamics on the angle of intended movement; and a unimodal dependence on intended angle for each channel of neural activity. Due to errors made in the decoding of noisy neural data; as a user attempts to move the cursor to a goal; the angle between cursor and goal positions may change rapidly. We propose a dynamic Bayesian network that includes the on-screen goal position as part of its latent state; and thus allows the person?s intended angle of movement to be aggregated over a much longer history of neural activity. This multiscale model explicitly captures the relationship between instantaneous angles of motion and long-term goals; and incorporates semi-Markov dynamics for motion trajectories. We also introduce a multimodal likelihood model for recordings of neural populations which can be rapidly calibrated for clinical applications. In offline experiments with recorded neural data; we demonstrate significantly improved prediction of motion directions compared to the Kalman filter. We derive an efficient online inference algorithm; enabling a clinical trial participant with tetraplegia to control a computer cursor with neural activity in real time. The observed kinematics of cursor movement are objectively straighter and smoother than prior iBCI decoding models without loss of responsiveness.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6688-multiscale-semi-markov-dynamics-for-intracortical-brain-computer-interfaces/bibtex,Daniel Milstein; Jason Pacheco; Leigh Hochberg; John D.

2017,Safe Model-based Reinforcement Learning with Stability Guarantees,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6692-safe-model-based-reinforcement-learning-with-stability-guarantees.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6692-safe-model-based-reinforcement-learning-with-stability-guarantees,Reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm for learning optimal policies from experimental data. However; to find optimal policies; most reinforcement learning algorithms explore all possible actions; which may be harmful for real-world systems. As a consequence; learning algorithms are rarely applied on safety-critical systems in the real world. In this paper; we present a learning algorithm that explicitly considers safety; defined in terms of stability guarantees. Specifically; we extend control-theoretic results on Lyapunov stability verification and show how to use statistical models of the dynamics to obtain high-performance control policies with provable stability certificates. Moreover; under additional regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior; we prove that one can effectively and safely collect data in order to learn about the dynamics and thus both improve control performance and expand the safe region of the state space. In our experiments; we show how the resulting algorithm can safely optimize a neural network policy on a simulated inverted pendulum; without the pendulum ever falling down.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6692-safe-model-based-reinforcement-learning-with-stability-guarantees/bibtex,Felix Berkenkamp; Matteo Turchetta; Angela Schoellig; Andreas Krause

Starting from the recent idea of viewpoint factorization; we propose a new approach that; given a large number of images of an object and no other supervision; can extract a dense object-centric coordinate frame. This coordinate frame is invariant to deformations of the images and comes with a dense equivariant labelling neural network that can map image pixels to their corresponding object coordinates. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to simple articulated objects and deformable objects such as human faces; learning embeddings from random synthetic transformations or optical flow correspondences; all without any manual supervision.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6686-unsupervised-learning-of-object-frames-by-dense-equivariant-image-labelling/bibtex,James Thewlis; Hakan Bilen; Andrea Vedaldi

Recent work has highlighted the power-law (multi-time scale) properties of brain signals; however; there remains a lack of methods to specifically quantify short- vs. long- time range brain connections. In this paper; using detrended partial cross-correlation analysis (DPCCA); we propose a novel functional connectivity measure to delineate brain interactions at multiple time scales; while controlling for covariates. We use a rich simulated fMRI dataset to validate the proposed method; and apply it to a real fMRI dataset in a cocaine dependence prediction task. We show that; compared to extant methods; the DPCCA-based approach not only distinguishes short and long memory functional connectivity but also improves feature extraction and enhances classification accuracy. Together; this paper contributes broadly to new computational methodologies in understanding neural information processing.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6690-detrended-partial-cross-correlation-for-brain-connectivity-analysis/bibtex,Jaime Ide; F?bio Cappabianco; Fabio Faria; Chiang-shan R.

2017,Compression-aware Training of Deep Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6687-compression-aware-training-of-deep-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6687-compression-aware-training-of-deep-networks,In recent years; great progress has been made in a variety of application domains thanks to the development of increasingly deeper neural networks. Unfortunately; the huge number of units of these networks makes them expensive both computationally and memory-wise. To overcome this; exploiting the fact that deep networks are over-parametrized; several compression strategies have been proposed. These methods; however; typically start from a network that has been trained in a standard manner; without considering such a future compression. In this paper; we propose to explicitly account for compression in the training process. To this end; we introduce a regularizer that encourages the parameter matrix of each layer to have low rank during training. We show that accounting for compression during training allows us to learn much more compact; yet at least as effective; models than state-of-the-art compression techniques.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6687-compression-aware-training-of-deep-networks/bibtex,Jose M.

We employ a reclassification-by-synthesis algorithm to perform training using a formulation stemmed from the Bayes theory. Our ICN tries to iteratively: (1) synthesize pseudo-negative samples; and (2) enhance itself by improving the classification. The single CNN classifier learned is at the same time generative --- being able to directly synthesize new samples within its own discriminative model. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets including MNIST; CIFAR-10; and SVHN using state-of-the-art CNN architectures; and observe improved classification results.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6684-introspective-classification-with-convolutional-nets/bibtex,Long Jin; Justin Lazarow; Zhuowen Tu
2017,Minimizing a Submodular Function from Samples,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6683-minimizing-a-submodular-function-from-samples.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6683-minimizing-a-submodular-function-from-samples,In this paper we consider the problem of minimizing a submodular function from training data. Submodular functions can be efficiently minimized and are conse- quently heavily applied in machine learning. There are many cases; however; in which we do not know the function we aim to optimize; but rather have access to training data that is used to learn the function. In this paper we consider the question of whether submodular functions can be minimized in such cases. We show that even learnable submodular functions cannot be minimized within any non-trivial approximation when given access to polynomially-many samples. Specifically; we show that there is a class of submodular functions with range in [0; 1] such that; despite being PAC-learnable and minimizable in polynomial-time; no algorithm can obtain an approximation strictly better than 1/2 ? o(1) using polynomially-many samples drawn from any distribution. Furthermore; we show that this bound is tight using a trivial algorithm that obtains an approximation of 1/2.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6683-minimizing-a-submodular-function-from-samples/bibtex,Eric Balkanski; Yaron Singer

It is possible to cause a neural network used for image recognition to misclassify its input by applying very specific; hardly perceptible perturbations to the input; called adversarial perturbations. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of these peculiar samples as well as several methods to mitigate them. A proven explanation remains elusive; however. In this work; we take steps towards a formal characterization of adversarial perturbations by deriving lower bounds on the magnitudes of perturbations necessary to change the classification of neural networks. The bounds are experimentally verified on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6682-lower-bounds-on-the-robustness-to-adversarial-perturbations/bibtex,Jonathan Peck; Joris Roels; Bart Goossens; Yvan Saeys

Utilizing the theory of reproducing kernels; we reduce this hypothesis to a simple one-sided score test for a scalar parameter; develop a testing procedure that is robust against the mis-specification of kernel functions; and also propose an ensemble-based estimator for the null model to guarantee test performance in small samples. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method; we apply our test to the problem of detecting nonlinear interaction between groups of continuous features. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of our test  under different data-generating functions and estimation strategies for the null model. Our results revealed interesting connection between notions in machine learning (model underfit/overfit) and those in statistical inference (i.e. Type I error/power of hypothesis test); and also highlighted unexpected consequences of common model estimating strategies (e.g. estimating kernel hyperparameters using maximum likelihood estimation) on model inference.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6681-robust-hypothesis-test-for-nonlinear-effect-with-gaussian-processes/bibtex,Jeremiah Liu; Brent Coull

MP and FW address optimization over the linear span and the convex hull of a set of atoms; respectively. In this paper; we consider the intermediate case of optimization over the convex cone; parametrized as the conic hull of a generic atom set; leading to the first principled definitions of non-negative MP algorithms for which we give explicit convergence rates and demonstrate excellent empirical performance. In particular; we derive sublinear (O(1/t)) convergence on general smooth and convex objectives; and linear convergence (O(e^{-t})) on strongly convex objectives; in both cases for general sets of atoms. Furthermore; we establish a clear correspondence of our algorithms to known algorithms from the MP and FW literature. Our novel algorithms and analyses target general atom sets and general objective functions; and hence are directly applicable to a large variety of learning settings.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6679-greedy-algorithms-for-cone-constrained-optimization-with-convergence-guarantees/bibtex,Francesco Locatello; Michael Tschannen; Gunnar Raetsch; Martin Jaggi

We include our prior in a formulation of image restoration as a Bayes estimator that also allows us to solve noise-blind image restoration problems. We show that the gradient of our prior corresponds to the mean-shift vector on the natural image distribution. In addition; we learn the mean-shift vector field using denoising autoencoders; and use it in a gradient descent approach to perform Bayes risk minimization. We demonstrate competitive results for noise-blind deblurring; super-resolution; and demosaicing.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6678-deep-mean-shift-priors-for-image-restoration/bibtex,Siavash Arjomand Bigdeli; Matthias Zwicker; Paolo Favaro; Meiguang Jin
2017,A New Theory for Matrix Completion,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6680-a-new-theory-for-matrix-completion.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6680-a-new-theory-for-matrix-completion,Prevalent matrix completion theories reply on an assumption that the locations of the missing data are distributed uniformly and randomly (i.e.; uniform sampling). Nevertheless; the reason for observations being missing often depends on the unseen observations themselves; and thus the missing data in practice usually occurs in a nonuniform and deterministic fashion rather than randomly. To break through the limits of random sampling; this paper introduces a new hypothesis called \emph{isomeric condition}; which is provably weaker than the assumption of uniform sampling and arguably holds even when the missing data is placed irregularly. Equipped with this new tool; we prove a series of theorems for missing data recovery and matrix completion. In particular; we prove that the exact solutions that identify the target matrix are included as critical points by the commonly used nonconvex programs. Unlike the existing theories for nonconvex matrix completion; which are built upon the same condition as convex programs; our theory shows that nonconvex programs have the potential to work with a much weaker condition. Comparing to the existing studies on nonuniform sampling; our setup is more general.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6680-a-new-theory-for-matrix-completion/bibtex,Guangcan Liu; Qingshan Liu; Xiaotong Yuan
2017,Improved Dynamic Regret for Non-degenerate Functions,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6675-improved-dynamic-regret-for-non-degenerate-functions.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6675-improved-dynamic-regret-for-non-degenerate-functions,Recently; there has been a growing research interest in the analysis of dynamic regret; which measures the performance of an online learner against a sequence of local minimizers. By exploiting the strong convexity; previous studies have shown that the dynamic regret can be upper bounded by the path-length of the comparator sequence. In this paper; we illustrate that the dynamic regret can be further improved by allowing the learner to query the gradient of the function multiple times; and meanwhile the strong convexity can be weakened to other non-degenerate conditions. Specifically; we introduce the squared path-length; which could be much smaller than the path-length; as a new regularity of the comparator sequence. When multiple gradients are accessible to the learner; we first demonstrate that the dynamic regret of strongly convex functions can be upper bounded by the minimum of the path-length and the squared path-length. We then extend our theoretical guarantee to functions that are semi-strongly convex or self-concordant. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first time that semi-strong convexity and self-concordance are utilized to tighten the dynamic regret.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6675-improved-dynamic-regret-for-non-degenerate-functions/bibtex,Lijun Zhang; Tianbao Yang; Jinfeng Yi; Jing Rong; Zhi-Hua Zhou
2017,Learning Efficient Object Detection Models with Knowledge Distillation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6676-learning-efficient-object-detection-models-with-knowledge-distillation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6676-learning-efficient-object-detection-models-with-knowledge-distillation,Despite significant accuracy improvement in convolutional neural networks (CNN) based object detectors; they often require prohibitive runtimes to process an image for real-time applications. State-of-the-art models often use very deep networks with a large number of floating point operations. Efforts such as model compression learn compact models with fewer number of parameters; but with much reduced accuracy. In this work; we propose a new framework to learn compact and fast ob- ject detection networks with improved accuracy using knowledge distillation [20] and hint learning [34]. Although knowledge distillation has demonstrated excellent improvements for simpler classification setups; the complexity of detection poses new challenges in the form of regression; region proposals and less voluminous la- bels. We address this through several innovations such as a weighted cross-entropy loss to address class imbalance; a teacher bounded loss to handle the regression component and adaptation layers to better learn from intermediate teacher distribu- tions. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation with different distillation configurations over multiple datasets including PASCAL; KITTI; ILSVRC and MS-COCO. Our results show consistent improvement in accuracy-speed trade-offs for modern multi-class detection models.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6676-learning-efficient-object-detection-models-with-knowledge-distillation/bibtex,Guobin Chen; Wongun Choi; Xiang Yu; Tony Han; Manmohan Chandraker
2017,One-Sided Unsupervised Domain Mapping,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6677-one-sided-unsupervised-domain-mapping.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6677-one-sided-unsupervised-domain-mapping,In unsupervised domain mapping; the learner is given two unmatched datasets $A$ and $B$. The goal is to learn a mapping $G_{AB}$ that translates a sample in $A$ to the analog sample in $B$. Recent approaches have shown that when learning simultaneously both $G_{AB}$ and the inverse mapping $G_{BA}$; convincing mappings are obtained. In this work; we present a method of learning $G_{AB}$ without learning $G_{BA}$. This is done by learning a mapping that maintains the distance between a pair of samples. Moreover; good mappings are obtained; even by maintaining the distance between different parts of the same sample before and after mapping. We present experimental results that the new method not only allows for one sided mapping learning; but also leads to preferable numerical results over the existing circularity-based constraint.

In this paper; we utilize the  emerging idea of ``coded computation'' to design a novel error-correcting-code inspired technique for solving linear inverse problems under specific iterative methods in a parallelized implementation affected by stragglers. Example machine-learning applications include inverse problems such as personalized PageRank and sampling on graphs. We provably show that our coded-computation technique can reduce the mean-squared error under a computational deadline constraint. In fact; the ratio of mean-squared error of replication-based and coded techniques diverges to infinity as the deadline increases. Our experiments for personalized PageRank performed on real systems and real social networks show that this ratio can be as large as $10^4$. Further; unlike coded-computation techniques proposed thus far; our strategy combines outputs of all workers; including the stragglers; to produce more accurate estimates at the computational deadline. This also ensures that the accuracy degrades ``gracefully'' in the event that the number of stragglers is large.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6673-coded-distributed-computing-for-inverse-problems/bibtex,Yaoqing Yang; Pulkit Grover; Soummya Kar

The simple closed-form screening rule is a necessary and sufficient condition for exactly recovering the blockwise structure of a solution under any given regularization parameters. With enough sparsity; the screening rule can be combined with various optimization procedures to deliver solutions efficiently in practice. The screening rule is especially suitable for large-scale exploratory data analysis; where the number of variables in the dataset can be thousands while we are only interested in the relationship among a handful of variables within moderate-size clusters for interpretability. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the efficiency and insights gained from the introduction of the screening rule.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6674-a-screening-rule-for-l1-regularized-ising-model-estimation/bibtex,Zhaobin Kuang; Sinong Geng; David Page
2017,Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6672-unsupervised-image-to-image-translation-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6672-unsupervised-image-to-image-translation-networks,Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims at learning a joint distribution of images in different domains by using images from the marginal distributions in individual domains. Since there exists an infinite set of joint distributions that can arrive the given marginal distributions; one could infer nothing about the joint distribution from the marginal distributions without additional assumptions. To address the problem; we make a shared-latent space assumption and propose an unsupervised image-to-image translation framework based on Coupled GANs. We compare the proposed framework with competing approaches and present high quality image translation results on various challenging unsupervised image translation tasks; including street scene image translation; animal image translation; and face image translation. We also apply the proposed framework to domain adaptation and achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Thus a subgame cannot be solved in isolation and must instead consider the strategy for the entire game as a whole; unlike perfect-information games. Nevertheless; it is possible to first approximate a solution for the whole game and then improve it in individual subgames. This is referred to as subgame solving. We introduce subgame-solving techniques that outperform prior methods both in theory and practice. We also show how to adapt them; and past subgame-solving techniques; to respond to opponent actions that are outside the original action abstraction; this significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art approach; action translation. Finally; we show that subgame solving can be repeated as the game progresses down the game tree; leading to far lower exploitability. These techniques were a key component of Libratus; the first AI to defeat top humans in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6671-safe-and-nested-subgame-solving-for-imperfect-information-games/bibtex,Noam Brown; Tuomas Sandholm

The use of mini-batches has become a golden standard in the machine learning community; because the mini-batch techniques stabilize the gradient estimate and can easily make good use of parallel computing. The core of our proposed method is the incorporation of our new ``double acceleration'' technique and variance reduction technique. We theoretically analyze our proposed method and show that our method much improves the mini-batch efficiencies of previous accelerated stochastic methods; and essentially only needs size $\sqrt{n}$ mini-batches for achieving the optimal iteration complexities for both non-strongly and strongly convex objectives; where $n$ is the training set size. Further; we show that even in non-mini-batch settings; our method achieves the best known convergence rate for non-strongly convex and strongly convex objectives.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6663-doubly-accelerated-stochastic-variance-reduced-dual-averaging-method-for-regularized-empirical-risk-minimization/bibtex,Tomoya Murata; Taiji Suzuki
2017,Avoiding Discrimination through Causal Reasoning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6668-avoiding-discrimination-through-causal-reasoning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6668-avoiding-discrimination-through-causal-reasoning,Recent work on fairness in machine learning has focused on various statistical discrimination criteria and how they trade off. Most of these criteria are observational: They depend only on the joint distribution of predictor; protected attribute; features; and outcome. While convenient to work with; observational criteria have severe inherent limitations that prevent them from resolving matters of fairness conclusively.  Going beyond observational criteria; we frame the problem of discrimination based on protected attributes in the language of causal reasoning. This viewpoint shifts attention from "What is the right fairness criterion?" to "What do we want to assume about our model of the causal data generating process?" Through the lens of causality; we make several contributions. First; we crisply articulate why and when observational criteria fail; thus formalizing what was before a matter of opinion. Second; our approach exposes previously ignored subtleties and why they are fundamental to the problem. Finally; we put forward natural causal non-discrimination criteria and develop algorithms that satisfy them.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6668-avoiding-discrimination-through-causal-reasoning/bibtex,Niki Kilbertus; Mateo Rojas Carulla; Giambattista Parascandolo; Moritz Hardt; Dominik Janzing; Bernhard Sch?lkopf

We prove that our proposed algorithm; dubbed geometric proximal gradient method (GeoPG); converges with a linear rate $(1-1/\sqrt{\kappa})$ and thus achieves the optimal rate among first-order methods; where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the problem. Numerical results on linear regression and logistic regression with elastic net regularization show that GeoPG compares favorably with Nesterov's accelerated proximal gradient method; especially when the problem is ill-conditioned.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6666-geometric-descent-method-for-convex-composite-minimization/bibtex,Shixiang Chen; Shiqian Ma; Wei Liu

This setting is in particular interesting since it captures natural online extensions of well-studied offline linear optimization problems which are NP-hard; yet admit efficient approximation algorithms. The goal here is to minimize the $\alpha$-regret which is the natural extension of the standard regret in online learning to this setting.   We present new  algorithms with significantly improved oracle complexity for both the full information and bandit variants of the problem. Mainly; for both variants; we present $\alpha$-regret bounds of $O(T^{-1/3})$; were $T$ is the number of prediction rounds; using only $O(\log(T))$ calls to the approximation oracle per iteration; on average. These are the first results to obtain both average oracle complexity of $O(\log(T))$ (or even poly-logarithmic in $T$) and $\alpha$-regret bound $O(T^{-c})$ for a positive constant $c$; for both variants.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6665-efficient-online-linear-optimization-with-approximation-algorithms/bibtex,Dan Garber

Oja's iteration maintains a running estimate of the true principal component from streaming data and enjoys less temporal and spatial complexities. We show that the Oja's iteration for the top eigenvector generates a continuous-state discrete-time Markov chain over the unit sphere. We characterize the Oja's iteration in three phases using diffusion approximation and weak convergence tools. Our three-phase analysis further provides a finite-sample error bound for the running estimate; which matches the minimax information lower bound for PCA under the additional assumption of bounded samples.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6667-diffusion-approximations-for-online-principal-component-estimation-and-global-convergence/bibtex,Chris Junchi Li; Mengdi Wang; Han Liu; Tong Zhang

Our algorithm learns the Mahalanobis metric based on the gradient outer product matrix $\boldsymbol{G}$ of the regression function (automatically adapting to the effective rank of this matrix); while simultaneously bounding the regret ---on the same data sequence--- in terms of the spectrum of $\boldsymbol{G}$. As a preliminary step in our analysis; we extend a nonparametric online learning algorithm by Hazan and Megiddo enabling it to compete against functions whose Lipschitzness is measured with respect to an arbitrary Mahalanobis metric.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6669-nonparametric-online-regression-while-learning-the-metric/bibtex,Ilja Kuzborskij; Nicol?

2017,Recycling Privileged Learning and Distribution Matching for Fairness,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6670-recycling-privileged-learning-and-distribution-matching-for-fairness.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6670-recycling-privileged-learning-and-distribution-matching-for-fairness,Equipping machine learning models with ethical and legal constraints is a serious issue; without this; the future of machine learning is at risk. This paper takes a step forward in this direction and focuses on ensuring machine learning models deliver fair decisions. In legal scholarships; the notion of fairness itself is evolving and multi-faceted. We set an overarching goal to develop a unified machine learning framework that is able to handle any definitions of fairness; their combinations; and also new definitions that might be stipulated in the future. To achieve our goal; we recycle two well-established machine learning techniques; privileged learning and distribution matching; and harmonize them for satisfying multi-faceted fairness definitions. We consider protected characteristics such as race and gender as privileged information that is available at training but not at test time; this accelerates model training and delivers fairness through unawareness. Further; we cast demographic parity; equalized odds; and equality of opportunity as a classical two-sample problem of conditional distributions; which can be solved in a general form by using distance measures in Hilbert Space. We show several existing models are special cases of ours. Finally; we advocate returning the Pareto frontier of multi-objective minimization of error and unfairness in predictions. This will facilitate decision makers to select an operating point and to be accountable for it.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6670-recycling-privileged-learning-and-distribution-matching-for-fairness/bibtex,Novi Quadrianto; Viktoriia Sharmanska

In this paper; a novel approach is proposed which divides the training process into two consecutive phases to obtain better generalization performance: Bayesian sampling and stochastic optimization. The first phase is to explore the energy landscape and to capture the `fat'' modes; and the second one is to fine-tune the parameter learned from the first phase. In the Bayesian learning phase; we apply continuous tempering and stochastic approximation into the Langevin dynamics to create an efficient and effective sampler; in which the temperature is adjusted automatically according to the designed ``temperature dynamics''.  These strategies can overcome the challenge of early trapping into bad local minima and have achieved remarkable improvements in various types of neural networks as shown in our theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6664-langevin-dynamics-with-continuous-tempering-for-training-deep-neural-networks/bibtex,Nanyang Ye; Zhanxing Zhu; Rafal Mantiuk
2017,Convergence Analysis of Two-layer Neural Networks with ReLU Activation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6662-convergence-analysis-of-two-layer-neural-networks-with-relu-activation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6662-convergence-analysis-of-two-layer-neural-networks-with-relu-activation,In recent years; stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based techniques has become the standard tools for training neural networks. However; formal theoretical understanding of why SGD can train neural networks in practice is largely missing.  In this paper; we make progress on understanding this mystery by providing a convergence analysis for SGD on a rich subset of two-layer feedforward networks with ReLU activations. This subset is characterized by a special structure called "identity mapping". We prove that; if input follows from Gaussian distribution; with standard $O(1/\sqrt{d})$ initialization of the weights; SGD converges to the global minimum in polynomial number of steps. Unlike normal vanilla networks; the "identity mapping" makes our network asymmetric and thus the global minimum is unique. To complement our theory; we are also able to show experimentally that multi-layer networks with this mapping have better performance compared with normal vanilla networks.  Our convergence theorem differs from traditional non-convex optimization techniques. We show that SGD converges to optimal in "two phases": In phase I; the gradient points to the wrong direction; however; a potential function $g$ gradually decreases. Then in phase II; SGD enters a nice one point convex region and converges. We also show that the identity mapping is necessary for convergence; as it moves the initial point to a better place for optimization. Experiment verifies our claims.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6662-convergence-analysis-of-two-layer-neural-networks-with-relu-activation/bibtex,Yuanzhi Li; Yang Yuan

In this paper; we tackle the problem of learning representations invariant to a specific factor or trait of data. The representation learning process is formulated as an adversarial minimax game. We analyze the optimal equilibrium of such a game and find that it amounts to maximizing the uncertainty of inferring the detrimental factor given the representation while maximizing the certainty of making task-specific predictions. On three benchmark tasks; namely fair and bias-free classification; language-independent generation; and lighting-independent image classification; we show that the proposed framework induces an invariant representation; and leads to better generalization evidenced by the improved performance.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6661-controllable-invariance-through-adversarial-feature-learning/bibtex,Qizhe Xie; Zihang Dai; Yulun Du; Eduard Hovy; Graham Neubig

Existing theoretical analysis either only studies specific algorithms or only presents upper bounds on the generalization error but not on the excess risk. In this paper; we propose a unified algorithm-dependent framework for HTL through a novel notion of transformation functions; which characterizes the relation between the source and the target domains. We conduct a general risk analysis of this framework and in particular; we show for the first time; if two domains are related; HTL enjoys faster convergence rates of excess risks for Kernel Smoothing and Kernel Ridge Regression than those of the classical non-transfer learning settings. We accompany this framework with an analysis of cross-validation for HTL to search for the best transfer technique and gracefully reduce to non-transfer learning when HTL is not helpful. Experiments on robotics and neural imaging data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6660-hypothesis-transfer-learning-via-transformation-functions/bibtex,Simon S.

In this paper; we look in particular at the task of learning a single visual representation that can be successfully utilized in the analysis of very different types of images; from dog breeds to stop signs and digits. Inspired by recent work on learning networks that predict the parameters of another; we develop a tunable deep network architecture that; by means of adapter residual modules; can be steered on the fly to diverse visual domains. Our method achieves a high degree of parameter sharing while maintaining or even improving the accuracy of domain-specific representations. We also introduce the Visual Decathlon Challenge; a benchmark that evaluates the ability of  representations to capture simultaneously ten very different visual domains and measures their ability to recognize well uniformly.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6654-learning-multiple-visual-domains-with-residual-adapters/bibtex,Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi; Hakan Bilen; Andrea Vedaldi

The visual question answering (VQA) problem is an excellent way to test such reasoning capabilities of an AI model and its multimodal representation learning. However; the current VQA models are over-simplified deep neural networks; comprised of a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit for question comprehension and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for learning single image representation. We argue that the single visual representation contains a limited and general information about the image contents and thus limits the model reasoning capabilities. In this work we introduce a modular neural network model that learns a multimodal and multifaceted representation of the image and the question. The proposed model learns to use the multimodal representation to reason about the image entities and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on both VQA benchmark datasets; VQA v1.0 and v2.0; by a wide margin.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6658-multimodal-learning-and-reasoning-for-visual-question-answering/bibtex,Ilija Ilievski; Jiashi Feng

The \atk loss provides a natural generalization of the two widely used ensemble losses; namely the average loss and the maximum loss. Furthermore; the \atk loss combines the advantages of them and can alleviate their corresponding drawbacks to better adapt to different data distributions. We show that the \atk loss affords an intuitive interpretation that reduces the penalty of continuous and convex individual losses on correctly classified data. The \atk loss can lead to convex optimization problems that can be solved effectively with conventional sub-gradient based method. We further study the Statistical Learning Theory of \matk by establishing its classification calibration and statistical consistency of \matk which provide useful insights on the practical choice of the  parameter $k$. We demonstrate the applicability of \matk learning combined with different individual loss functions for binary and multi-class classification and regression using synthetic and real datasets.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6653-learning-with-average-top-k-loss/bibtex,Yanbo Fan; Siwei Lyu; Yiming Ying; Baogang Hu

The absolute error is a canonical example. Many existing methods for this task reduce to binary classification problems and employ surrogate losses; such as the hinge loss. We instead derive uniquely defined surrogate ordinal regression loss functions by seeking the predictor that is robust to the worst-case approximations of training data labels; subject to matching certain provided training data statistics. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach over other surrogate losses based on hinge loss approximations using UCI ordinal prediction tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6659-adversarial-surrogate-losses-for-ordinal-regression/bibtex,Rizal Fathony; Mohammad Ali Bashiri; Brian Ziebart
2017,MarrNet: 3D Shape Reconstruction via 2.5D Sketches,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6657-marrnet-3d-shape-reconstruction-via-25d-sketches.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6657-marrnet-3d-shape-reconstruction-via-25d-sketches,3D object reconstruction from a single image is a highly under-determined problem; requiring strong prior knowledge of plausible 3D shapes. This introduces challenge for learning-based approaches; as 3D object annotations in real images are scarce. Previous work chose to train on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information; but suffered from the domain adaptation issue when tested on real data.  In this work; we propose an end-to-end trainable framework; sequentially estimating 2.5D sketches and 3D object shapes. Our disentangled; two-step formulation has three advantages. First; compared to full 3D shape; 2.5D sketches are much easier to be recovered from a 2D image; and to transfer from synthetic to real data. Second; for 3D reconstruction from the 2.5D sketches; we can easily transfer the learned model on synthetic data to real images; as rendered 2.5D sketches are invariant to object appearance variations in real images; including lighting; texture; etc. This further relieves the domain adaptation problem. Third; we derive differentiable projective functions from 3D shape to 2.5D sketches; making the framework end-to-end trainable on real images; requiring no real-image annotations. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape reconstruction.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6657-marrnet-3d-shape-reconstruction-via-25d-sketches/bibtex,Jiajun Wu; Yifan Wang; Tianfan Xue; Xingyuan Sun; Bill Freeman; Josh Tenenbaum
2017,Learning Spherical Convolution for Fast Features from 360? Imagery,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6656-learning-spherical-convolution-for-fast-features-from-360-imagery.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6656-learning-spherical-convolution-for-fast-features-from-360-imagery,While 360? cameras offer tremendous new possibilities in vision; graphics; and augmented reality; the spherical images they produce make core feature extraction non-trivial. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on images from perspective cameras yield ?flat" filters; yet 360? images cannot be projected to a single plane without significant distortion. A naive solution that repeatedly projects the viewing sphere to all tangent planes is accurate; but much too computationally intensive for real problems. We propose to learn a spherical convolutional network that translates a planar CNN to process 360? imagery directly in its equirectangular projection. Our approach learns to reproduce the flat filter outputs on 360? data; sensitive to the varying distortion effects across the viewing sphere. The key benefits are 1) efficient feature extraction for 360? images and video; and 2) the ability to leverage powerful pre-trained networks researchers have carefully honed (together with massive labeled image training sets) for perspective images. We validate our approach compared to several alternative methods in terms of both raw CNN output accuracy as well as applying a state-of-the-art ?flat" object detector to 360? data. Our method yields the most accurate results while saving orders of magnitude in computation versus the existing exact reprojection solution.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6656-learning-spherical-convolution-for-fast-features-from-360-imagery/bibtex,Yu-Chuan Su; Kristen Grauman

We prove that coordinate descent for a regularized regression problem; in which the penalty is a separable sum of support functions; is exactly equivalent to Dykstra's algorithm applied to the dual problem. ADMM on the dual problem is also seen to be equivalent; in the special case of two sets; with one being a linear subspace. These connections; aside from being interesting in their own right; suggest new ways of analyzing and extending coordinate descent. For example; from existing convergence theory on Dykstra's algorithm over polyhedra; we discern that coordinate descent for the lasso problem converges at an (asymptotically) linear rate. We also develop two parallel versions of coordinate descent; based on the Dykstra and ADMM connections.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6655-dykstras-algorithm-admm-and-coordinate-descent-connections-insights-and-extensions/bibtex,Ryan J.

2017,Mixture-Rank Matrix Approximation for Collaborative Filtering,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6651-mixture-rank-matrix-approximation-for-collaborative-filtering.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6651-mixture-rank-matrix-approximation-for-collaborative-filtering,Low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) methods have achieved excellent accuracy among today's collaborative filtering (CF) methods. In existing LRMA methods; the rank of user/item feature matrices is typically fixed; i.e.; the same rank is adopted to describe all users/items. However; our studies show that submatrices with different ranks could coexist in the same user-item rating matrix; so that approximations with fixed ranks cannot perfectly describe the internal structures of the rating matrix; therefore leading to inferior recommendation accuracy. In this paper; a mixture-rank matrix approximation (MRMA) method is proposed; in which user-item ratings can be characterized by a mixture of LRMA models with different ranks. Meanwhile; a learning algorithm capitalizing on iterated condition modes is proposed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem pertaining to MRMA. Experimental studies on MovieLens and Netflix datasets demonstrate that MRMA can outperform six state-of-the-art LRMA-based CF methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6651-mixture-rank-matrix-approximation-for-collaborative-filtering/bibtex,Dongsheng Li; Chao Chen; Wei Liu; Tun Lu; Ning Gu; Stephen Chu
2017,Toward Multimodal Image-to-Image Translation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6650-toward-multimodal-image-to-image-translation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6650-toward-multimodal-image-to-image-translation,Many image-to-image translation problems are ambiguous; as a single input image may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work; we aim to model a distribution of possible outputs in a conditional generative modeling setting. The ambiguity of the mapping is distilled in a low-dimensional latent vector; which can be randomly sampled at test time. A generator learns to map the given input; combined with this latent code; to the output. We explicitly encourage the connection between output and the latent code to be invertible. This helps prevent a many-to-one mapping from the latent code to the output during training; also known as the problem of mode collapse; and produces more diverse results. We explore several variants of this approach by employing different training objectives; network architectures; and methods of injecting the latent code. Our proposed method encourages bijective consistency between the latent encoding and output modes. We present a systematic comparison of our method and other variants on both perceptual realism and diversity.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6650-toward-multimodal-image-to-image-translation/bibtex,Jun-Yan Zhu; Richard Zhang; Deepak Pathak; Trevor Darrell; Alexei A.

2017,f-GANs in an Information Geometric Nutshell,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6649-f-gans-in-an-information-geometric-nutshell.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6649-f-gans-in-an-information-geometric-nutshell,Nowozin \textit{et al} showed last year how to extend the GAN \textit{principle} to all $f$-divergences. The approach is elegant but falls short of a full description of the supervised game; and says little about the key player; the generator: for example; what does the generator actually converge to if solving the GAN game means convergence in some space of parameters? How does that provide hints on the generator's design and compare to the flourishing but almost exclusively experimental literature on the subject? In this paper; we unveil a broad class of distributions for which such convergence happens --- namely; deformed exponential families; a wide superset of exponential families ---. We show that current deep architectures are able to factorize a very large number of such densities using an especially compact design; hence displaying the power of deep architectures and their concinnity in the $f$-GAN game. This result holds given a sufficient condition on \textit{activation functions} ---  which turns out to be satisfied by popular choices. The key to our results is a variational generalization of an old theorem that relates the KL divergence between regular exponential families and divergences between their natural parameters.

2017,Continuous DR-submodular  Maximization: Structure and Algorithms,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6652-continuous-dr-submodular-maximization-structure-and-algorithms.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6652-continuous-dr-submodular-maximization-structure-and-algorithms,DR-submodular continuous functions are important objectives with wide real-world applications spanning MAP inference in  determinantal point processes (DPPs); and mean-field inference for probabilistic submodular models; amongst others. DR-submodularity captures a subclass of non-convex functions that enables both exact minimization and approximate maximization in polynomial time.  In this work we study the  problem of maximizing  non-monotone DR-submodular continuous functions under general down-closed convex constraints. We start by investigating geometric properties that underlie such objectives; e.g.; a strong relation between  (approximately) stationary points and global optimum is proved. These properties are then used to devise two optimization algorithms with provable guarantees. Concretely; we first devise a "two-phase'' algorithm with 1/4 approximation guarantee. This algorithm allows the use of existing methods for finding (approximately) stationary points as a subroutine; thus; harnessing recent progress in non-convex optimization. Then we present a non-monotone Frank-Wolfe variant with 1/e approximation guarantee and sublinear convergence rate. Finally; we extend our approach to a broader class of generalized DR-submodular continuous functions; which captures a wider spectrum of applications. Our theoretical findings are validated on synthetic and real-world problem instances.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6652-continuous-dr-submodular-maximization-structure-and-algorithms/bibtex,An Bian; Kfir Levy; Andreas Krause; Joachim M.

2017,Preventing Gradient Explosions in Gated Recurrent Units,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6647-preventing-gradient-explosions-in-gated-recurrent-units.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6647-preventing-gradient-explosions-in-gated-recurrent-units,A gated recurrent unit (GRU) is a successful recurrent neural network architecture for time-series data. The GRU is typically trained using a gradient-based method; which is subject to the exploding gradient problem in which the gradient increases significantly. This problem is caused by an abrupt change in the dynamics of the GRU due to a small variation in the parameters. In this paper; we find a condition under which the dynamics of the GRU changes drastically and propose a learning method to address the exploding gradient problem. Our method constrains the dynamics of the GRU so that it does not drastically change. We evaluated our method in experiments on language modeling and polyphonic music modeling. Our experiments showed that our method can prevent the exploding gradient problem and improve modeling accuracy.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6647-preventing-gradient-explosions-in-gated-recurrent-units/bibtex,Sekitoshi Kanai; Yasuhiro Fujiwara; Sotetsu Iwamura
2017,Inference in Graphical Models via Semidefinite Programming Hierarchies,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6645-inference-in-graphical-models-via-semidefinite-programming-hierarchies.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6645-inference-in-graphical-models-via-semidefinite-programming-hierarchies,Maximum A posteriori Probability (MAP) inference in graphical models amounts to solving a graph-structured  combinatorial optimization problem. Popular inference algorithms such as belief propagation (BP) and generalized belief propagation (GBP) are intimately related to linear programming (LP) relaxation  within the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. Despite the popularity of these algorithms;  it is well understood that the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy based on semidefinite programming (SDP) can provide superior guarantees. Unfortunately; SOS relaxations for a graph with $n$ vertices require solving an SDP with $n^{\Theta(d)}$ variables where $d$ is the degree in the hierarchy. In practice; for $d\ge 4$; this approach does not scale beyond a few tens of variables. In this paper; we propose binary SDP relaxations for MAP inference using the SOS hierarchy with two innovations focused on computational efficiency. Firstly; in analogy to BP and its variants; we only introduce decision variables corresponding to contiguous regions in the graphical model. Secondly; we solve the resulting SDP using a non-convex Burer-Monteiro style method; and develop a sequential rounding procedure. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm can solve problems with tens of thousands of variables within minutes; and outperforms BP and GBP on practical problems such as image denoising and Ising spin glasses. Finally; for specific graph types; we establish a sufficient condition for the tightness of the proposed partial SOS relaxation.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6645-inference-in-graphical-models-via-semidefinite-programming-hierarchies/bibtex,Murat A.

This observation leads to many interesting results on general high-rank matrix estimation problems: 1.High-rank matrix completion: we show that it is possible to recover a {general high-rank matrix} $\mat A$ up to $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error in Frobenius norm from partial observations; with sample complexity independent of the spectral gap of $\mat A$. 2.High-rank matrix denoising: we design algorithms that recovers a matrix $\mat A$ with relative error in Frobenius norm from its noise-perturbed observations; without assuming $\mat A$ is exactly low-rank. 3.Low-dimensional estimation of high-dimensional covariance: given $N$ i.i.d.~samples of dimension $n$ from $\mathcal N_n(\mat 0;\mat A)$; we show that it is possible to estimate the covariance matrix $\mat A$ with relative error in Frobenius norm with $N\approx n$;improving over classical covariance estimation results which requires $N\approx n^2$.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6648-on-the-power-of-truncated-svd-for-general-high-rank-matrix-estimation-problems/bibtex,Simon S.

Our generation framework PG$^2$ utilizes the pose information explicitly and consists of two key stages: pose integration and image refinement. In the first stage the condition image and the target pose are fed into a U-Net-like network to generate an initial but coarse image of the person with the target pose. The second stage then refines the initial and blurry result by training a U-Net-like generator in an adversarial way. Extensive experimental results on both 128$\times$64 re-identification images and 256$\times$256 fashion photos show that our model generates high-quality person images with convincing details.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6644-pose-guided-person-image-generation/bibtex,Liqian Ma; Xu Jia; Qianru Sun; Bernt Schiele; Tinne Tuytelaars; Luc Van Gool

While practitioners often employ variable importance methods that rely on this impurity-based information; these methods remain poorly characterized from a theoretical perspective. We provide novel insights into the performance of these methods by deriving finite sample performance guarantees in a high-dimensional setting under various modeling assumptions.  We further demonstrate the effectiveness of these impurity-based methods via an extensive set of simulations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6646-variable-importance-using-decision-trees/bibtex,Jalil Kazemitabar; Arash Amini; Adam Bloniarz; Ameet S.

2017,On the Model Shrinkage Effect of Gamma Process Edge Partition Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6643-on-the-model-shrinkage-effect-of-gamma-process-edge-partition-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6643-on-the-model-shrinkage-effect-of-gamma-process-edge-partition-models,The edge partition model (EPM) is a fundamental Bayesian nonparametric model for extracting an overlapping structure from binary matrix. The EPM adopts a gamma process ($\Gamma$P) prior to automatically shrink the number of active atoms. However; we empirically found that the model shrinkage of the EPM does not typically work appropriately and leads to an overfitted solution. An analysis of the expectation of the EPM's intensity function suggested that the gamma priors for the EPM hyperparameters disturb the model shrinkage effect of the internal $\Gamma$P. In order to ensure that the model shrinkage effect of the EPM works in an appropriate manner; we proposed two novel generative constructions of the EPM: CEPM incorporating constrained gamma priors; and DEPM incorporating Dirichlet priors instead of the gamma priors. Furthermore; all DEPM's model parameters including the infinite atoms of the $\Gamma$P prior could be marginalized out; and thus it was possible to derive a truly infinite DEPM (IDEPM) that can be efficiently inferred using a collapsed Gibbs sampler. We experimentally confirmed that the model shrinkage of the proposed models works well and that the IDEPM indicated state-of-the-art performance in generalization ability; link prediction accuracy; mixing efficiency; and convergence speed.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6643-on-the-model-shrinkage-effect-of-gamma-process-edge-partition-models/bibtex,Iku Ohama; Issei Sato; Takuya Kida; Hiroki Arimura

In the noiseless setting; we identify an exact asymptotic threshold on the required number of tests with optimal decoding; and prove a {\em phase transition} between complete success and complete failure.  In addition; we present a novel {\em noisy} variation of the problem; and provide an information-theoretic framework for characterizing the required number of tests for general random noise models.  Our results reveal that noise can make the problem considerably more difficult; with strict increases in the scaling laws even at low noise levels.  Finally; we demonstrate similar behavior in an {\em approximate recovery} setting; where a given number of errors is allowed in the decoded labels.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6641-phase-transitions-in-the-pooled-data-problem/bibtex,Jonathan Scarlett; Volkan Cevher

Existing feed-forward based methods; while enjoying the inference efficiency; are mainly limited by inability of generalizing to unseen styles or compromised visual quality. In this paper; we present a simple yet effective method that tackles these limitations without training on any pre-defined styles. The key ingredient of our method is a pair of feature transforms; whitening and coloring; that are embedded to an image reconstruction network. The whitening and coloring transforms reflect direct matching of feature covariance of the content image to a given style image; which shares similar spirits with the optimization of Gram matrix based cost in neural style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by generating high-quality stylized images with comparisons to a number of recent methods. We also analyze our method by visualizing the whitened features and synthesizing textures by simple feature coloring.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6642-universal-style-transfer-via-feature-transforms/bibtex,Yijun Li; Chen Fang; Jimei Yang; Zhaowen Wang; Xin Lu; Ming-Hsuan Yang

It has been known that using binary weights and activations drastically reduce memory size and accesses; and can replace arithmetic operations with more efficient bitwise operations; leading to much faster test-time inference and lower power consumption. However; previous works on binarizing CNNs usually result in severe prediction accuracy degradation. In this paper; we address this issue with two major innovations: (1) approximating full-precision weights with the linear combination of multiple binary weight bases; (2) employing multiple binary activations to alleviate information loss. The implementation of the resulting binary CNN; denoted as ABC-Net; is shown to achieve much closer performance to its full-precision counterpart; and even reach the comparable prediction accuracy on ImageNet and forest trail datasets; given adequate binary weight bases and activations.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6638-towards-accurate-binary-convolutional-neural-network/bibtex,Xiaofan Lin; Cong Zhao; Wei Pan
2017,Gated Recurrent Convolution Neural Network for OCR,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6637-gated-recurrent-convolution-neural-network-for-ocr.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6637-gated-recurrent-convolution-neural-network-for-ocr,Optical Character Recognition (OCR) aims to recognize text in natural images. Inspired by a recently proposed model for general image classification; Recurrent Convolution Neural Network (RCNN); we propose a new architecture named Gated RCNN (GRCNN) for solving this problem. Its critical component; Gated Recurrent Convolution Layer (GRCL); is constructed by adding a gate to the Recurrent Convolution Layer (RCL); the critical component of RCNN. The gate controls the context modulation in RCL and balances the feed-forward information and the recurrent information. In addition; an efficient Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) is built for sequence modeling. The GRCNN is combined with BLSTM to recognize text in natural images. The entire GRCNN-BLSTM model can be trained end-to-end. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets including the IIIT-5K; Street View Text (SVT) and ICDAR.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6637-gated-recurrent-convolution-neural-network-for-ocr/bibtex,Jianfeng Wang; Xiaolin Hu

In contrast to recent learning based methods for 3D reconstruction; we leverage the underlying 3D geometry of the problem through feature projection and unprojection along viewing rays. By formulating these operations in a differentiable manner; we are able to learn the system end-to-end for the task of metric 3D reconstruction. End-to-end learning allows us to jointly reason about shape priors while conforming to geometric constraints; enabling reconstruction from much fewer images (even a single image) than required by classical approaches as well as completion of unseen surfaces. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on the ShapeNet dataset and demonstrate the benefits over classical approaches and recent learning based methods.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6640-learning-a-multi-view-stereo-machine/bibtex,Abhishek Kar; Christian H?ne; Jitendra Malik

To capture the temporal coherence; in this paper; we develop MaskRNN; a recurrent neural net approach which fuses in each frame the output of two deep nets for each object instance - a binary segmentation net providing a mask and a localization net providing a bounding box. Due to the recurrent component and the localization component; our method is able to take advantage of long-term temporal structures of the video data as well as rejecting outliers. We validate the proposed algorithm on three challenging benchmark datasets; the DAVIS-2016 dataset; the DAVIS-2017 dataset; and the Segtrack v2 dataset; achieving state-of-the-art performance on all of them.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6636-maskrnn-instance-level-video-object-segmentation/bibtex,Yuan-Ting Hu; Jia-Bin Huang; Alexander Schwing
2017,Semi-Supervised Learning for Optical Flow with Generative Adversarial Networks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6639-semi-supervised-learning-for-optical-flow-with-generative-adversarial-networks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6639-semi-supervised-learning-for-optical-flow-with-generative-adversarial-networks,Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been applied to the optical flow estimation problem. As training the CNNs requires sufficiently large ground truth training data; existing approaches resort to synthetic; unrealistic datasets. On the other hand; unsupervised methods are capable of leveraging real-world videos for training where the ground truth flow fields are not available. These methods; however; rely on the fundamental assumptions of brightness constancy and spatial smoothness priors which do not hold near motion boundaries. In this paper; we propose to exploit unlabeled videos for semi-supervised learning of optical flow with a Generative Adversarial Network. Our key insight is that the adversarial loss can capture the structural patterns of flow warp errors without making explicit assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised algorithm performs favorably against purely supervised and semi-supervised learning schemes.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6639-semi-supervised-learning-for-optical-flow-with-generative-adversarial-networks/bibtex,Wei-Sheng Lai; Jia-Bin Huang; Ming-Hsuan Yang
2017,A simple model of recognition and recall memory,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6633-a-simple-model-of-recognition-and-recall-memory.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6633-a-simple-model-of-recognition-and-recall-memory,We show that several striking differences in memory performance between recognition and recall tasks are explained by an ecological bias endemic in classic memory experiments - that such experiments universally involve more stimuli than retrieval cues. We show that while it is sensible to think of recall as simply retrieving items when probed with a cue - typically the item list itself -  it is better to think of recognition as retrieving cues when probed with items. To test this theory; by manipulating the number of items and cues in a memory experiment; we show a crossover effect in memory performance within subjects such that recognition performance is superior to recall performance when the number of items is greater than the number of cues and recall performance is better than recognition when the converse holds. We build a simple computational model around this theory; using sampling to approximate an ideal Bayesian observer encoding and retrieving situational co-occurrence frequencies of stimuli and retrieval cues. This model robustly reproduces a number of dissociations in recognition and recall previously used to argue for dual-process accounts of declarative memory.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6633-a-simple-model-of-recognition-and-recall-memory/bibtex,Nisheeth Srivastava; Edward Vul
2017,Best of Both Worlds: Transferring Knowledge from Discriminative Learning to a Generative Visual Dialog Model,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6635-best-of-both-worlds-transferring-knowledge-from-discriminative-learning-to-a-generative-visual-dialog-model.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6635-best-of-both-worlds-transferring-knowledge-from-discriminative-learning-to-a-generative-visual-dialog-model,We present a novel training framework for neural sequence models; particularly for grounded dialog generation. The standard training paradigm for these models is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); or minimizing the cross-entropy of the human responses. Across a variety of domains; a recurring problem with MLE trained generative neural dialog models (G) is that they tend to produce 'safe' and generic responses like "I don't know"; "I can't tell"). In contrast; discriminative dialog models (D) that are trained to rank a list of candidate human responses outperform their generative counterparts; in terms of automatic metrics; diversity; and informativeness of the responses. However; D is not useful in practice since it can not be deployed to have real conversations with users.   Our work aims to achieve the best of both worlds -- the practical usefulness of G and the strong performance of D -- via knowledge transfer from D to G. Our primary contribution is an end-to-end trainable generative visual dialog model; where G receives gradients from D as a perceptual (not adversarial) loss of the sequence sampled from G. We leverage the recently proposed Gumbel-Softmax (GS) approximation to the discrete distribution -- specifically; a RNN is augmented with a sequence of GS samplers; which coupled with the straight-through gradient estimator enables end-to-end differentiability. We also introduce a stronger encoder for visual dialog; and employ a self-attention mechanism for answer encoding along with a metric learning loss to aid D in better capturing semantic similarities in answer responses. Overall; our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art on the VisDial dataset by a significant margin (2.67% on recall@10).

We study the norms obtained from extending the k-support norm and OWL norms to the setting in which there are overlapping groups. The resulting norms are in general NP-hard to compute; but they are tractable for certain collections of groups. To demonstrate this fact; we  develop a dynamic program for the problem of projecting onto the set of vectors supported by a fixed number of groups. Our dynamic program utilizes tree decompositions and its complexity scales with the treewidth. This program can be converted to an extended formulation which; for the associated group structure; models the k-group support norms and an overlapping group variant of the ordered weighted l1 norm. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the new penalties.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6632-k-support-and-ordered-weighted-sparsity-for-overlapping-groups-hardness-and-algorithms/bibtex,Cong Han Lim; Stephen Wright

For any task loss; we construct a convex surrogate that can be optimized via stochastic gradient descent and we prove tight bounds on the so-called "calibration function" relating the excess surrogate risk to the actual risk. In contrast to prior related work; we carefully monitor the effect of the exponential number of classes in the learning guarantees as well as on the optimization complexity. As an interesting consequence; we formalize the intuition that some task losses make learning harder than others; and that the classical 0-1 loss is ill-suited for structured prediction.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6634-on-structured-prediction-theory-with-calibrated-convex-surrogate-losses/bibtex,Anton Osokin; Francis Bach; Simon Lacoste-Julien
2017,From Parity to Preference-based Notions of Fairness in Classification,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6627-from-parity-to-preference-based-notions-of-fairness-in-classification.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6627-from-parity-to-preference-based-notions-of-fairness-in-classification,The adoption of automated; data-driven decision making in an ever expanding range of applications has raised concerns about its potential unfairness towards certain social groups. In this context; a number of recent studies have focused on defining; detecting; and removing unfairness from data-driven decision systems. However; the existing notions of fairness; based on parity (equality) in treatment or outcomes for different social groups; tend to be quite stringent; limiting the overall decision making accuracy. In this paper; we draw inspiration from the fair-division and envy-freeness literature in economics and game theory and propose preference-based notions of fairness -- given the choice between various sets of decision treatments or outcomes; any group of users would collectively prefer its treatment or outcomes; regardless of the (dis)parity as compared to the other groups. Then; we introduce tractable proxies to design margin-based classifiers that satisfy these preference-based notions of fairness. Finally; we experiment with a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets and show that preference-based fairness allows for greater decision accuracy than parity-based fairness.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6627-from-parity-to-preference-based-notions-of-fairness-in-classification/bibtex,Muhammad Bilal Zafar; Isabel Valera; Manuel Rodriguez; Krishna Gummadi; Adrian Weller
2017,Inferring Generative Model Structure with Static Analysis,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6628-inferring-generative-model-structure-with-static-analysis.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6628-inferring-generative-model-structure-with-static-analysis,Obtaining enough labeled data to robustly train complex discriminative models is a major bottleneck in the machine learning pipeline. A popular solution is combining multiple sources of weak supervision using generative models. The structure of these models affects the quality of the training labels; but is difficult to learn without any ground truth labels. We instead rely on weak supervision sources having some structure by virtue of being encoded programmatically. We present Coral; a paradigm that infers generative model structure by statically analyzing the code for these heuristics; thus significantly reducing the amount of data required to learn structure. We prove that Coral's sample complexity scales quasilinearly with the number of heuristics and number of relations identified; improving over the standard sample complexity; which is exponential in n for learning n-th degree relations. Empirically; Coral matches or outperforms traditional structure learning approaches by up to 3.81 F1 points. Using Coral to model dependencies instead of assuming independence results in better performance than a fully supervised model by 3.07 accuracy points when heuristics are used to label radiology data without ground truth labels.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6628-inferring-generative-model-structure-with-static-analysis/bibtex,Paroma Varma; Bryan D.

2017,Group Sparse Additive Machine,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6624-group-sparse-additive-machine.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6624-group-sparse-additive-machine,A family of learning algorithms generated from additive models have attracted much attention recently for their flexibility and interpretability in high dimensional data analysis. Among them; learning models with grouped variables have shown competitive performance for prediction and variable selection. However; the previous works mainly focus on the least squares regression problem; not the classification task. Thus; it is desired to design the new additive classification model with variable selection capability for many real-world applications which focus on high-dimensional data classification. To address this challenging problem; in this paper; we investigate the classification with group sparse additive models in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. A novel classification method; called as \emph{group sparse additive machine} (GroupSAM); is proposed to explore and utilize the structure information among the input variables. Generalization error bound is derived and proved by integrating the sample error analysis with empirical covering numbers and the hypothesis error estimate with the stepping stone technique. Our new bound shows that GroupSAM can achieve a satisfactory learning rate with polynomial decay. Experimental results on synthetic data and seven benchmark datasets consistently show the effectiveness of our new approach.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6624-group-sparse-additive-machine/bibtex,Hong Chen; Xiaoqian Wang; Cheng Deng; Heng Huang

In this paper; we investiage a broad class of sparse learning approaches formulated as linear programs parametrized by a {\em regularization factor}; and solve them by the parametric simplex method (PSM). PSM offers significant advantages over other competing methods: (1) PSM naturally obtains the complete solution path for all values of the regularization parameter; (2) PSM provides a high precision dual certificate stopping criterion; (3) PSM yields sparse solutions through very few iterations; and the solution sparsity significantly reduces the computational cost per iteration. Particularly; we demonstrate the superiority of PSM over various sparse learning approaches; including Dantzig selector for sparse linear regression; sparse support vector machine for sparse linear classification; and sparse differential network estimation. We then provide sufficient conditions under which PSM always outputs sparse solutions such that its computational performance can be significantly boosted.

2017,Uprooting and Rerooting Higher-Order Graphical Models,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6625-uprooting-and-rerooting-higher-order-graphical-models.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6625-uprooting-and-rerooting-higher-order-graphical-models,The idea of uprooting and rerooting graphical models was introduced specifically for binary pairwise models by Weller (2016) as a way to transform a model to any of a whole equivalence class of related models; such that inference on any one model yields inference results for all others. This is very helpful since inference; or relevant bounds; may be much easier to obtain or more accurate for some model in the class. Here we introduce methods to extend the approach to models with higher-order potentials and develop theoretical insights. In particular; we show that the triplet-consistent polytope TRI is unique in being `universally rooted'. We demonstrate  empirically that rerooting can significantly improve accuracy of methods of inference for higher-order models at negligible computational cost.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6625-uprooting-and-rerooting-higher-order-graphical-models/bibtex,Mark Rowland; Adrian Weller
2017,Label Efficient Learning of Transferable Representations acrosss Domains and Tasks,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6621-label-efficient-learning-of-transferable-representations-acrosss-domains-and-tasks.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6621-label-efficient-learning-of-transferable-representations-acrosss-domains-and-tasks,We propose a framework that learns a representation transferable across different domains and tasks in a data efficient manner. Our approach battles domain shift with a domain adversarial loss; and generalizes the embedding to novel task using a metric learning-based approach. Our model is simultaneously optimized on labeled source data and unlabeled or sparsely labeled data in the target domain. Our method shows compelling results on novel classes within a new domain even when only a few labeled examples per class are available; outperforming the prevalent fine-tuning approach. In addition; we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the transfer learning task from image object recognition to video action recognition.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6621-label-efficient-learning-of-transferable-representations-acrosss-domains-and-tasks/bibtex,Zelun Luo; Yuliang Zou; Judy Hoffman; Li F.

2017,Learning to See Physics via Visual De-animation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6620-learning-to-see-physics-via-visual-de-animation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6620-learning-to-see-physics-via-visual-de-animation,We introduce a paradigm for understanding physical scenes without human annotations. At the core of our system is a physical world representation that is first recovered by a perception module and then utilized by physics and graphics engines. During training; the perception module and the generative models learn by visual de-animation --- interpreting and reconstructing the visual information stream. During testing; the system first recovers the physical world state; and then uses the generative models for reasoning and future prediction.  Even more so than forward simulation; inverting a physics or graphics engine is a computationally hard problem; we overcome this challenge by using a convolutional inversion network. Our system quickly recognizes the physical world state from appearance and motion cues; and has the flexibility to incorporate both differentiable and non-differentiable physics and graphics engines. We evaluate our system on both synthetic and real datasets involving multiple physical scenes; and demonstrate that our system performs well on both physical state estimation and reasoning problems. We further show that the knowledge learned on the synthetic dataset generalizes to constrained real images.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6620-learning-to-see-physics-via-visual-de-animation/bibtex,Jiajun Wu; Erika Lu; Pushmeet Kohli; Bill Freeman; Josh Tenenbaum
2017,Decoding with Value Networks for Neural Machine Translation,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6622-decoding-with-value-networks-for-neural-machine-translation.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6622-decoding-with-value-networks-for-neural-machine-translation,Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has become a popular technology in recent years; and beam search is its de facto decoding method due to the shrunk search space and reduced computational complexity. However; since it only searches for local optima at each time step through one-step forward looking; it usually cannot output the best target sentence. Inspired by the success and methodology of AlphaGo; in this paper we propose using a prediction network to improve beam search; which takes the source sentence $x$; the currently available decoding output $y_1;\cdots; y_{t-1}$ and a candidate word $w$ at step $t$ as inputs and predicts the long-term value (e.g.; BLEU score) of the partial target sentence if it is completed by the NMT model. Following the practice in reinforcement learning; we call this prediction network \emph{value network}. Specifically; we propose a recurrent structure for the value network; and train its parameters from bilingual data. During the test time; when  choosing a word $w$ for decoding; we consider both its conditional probability given by the NMT model and its long-term value predicted by the value network. Experiments show that such an approach can significantly improve the translation accuracy on several translation tasks.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6622-decoding-with-value-networks-for-neural-machine-translation/bibtex,Di He; Hanqing Lu; Yingce Xia; Tao Qin; Liwei Wang; Tieyan Liu
2017,Interactive Submodular Bandit,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6619-interactive-submodular-bandit.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6619-interactive-submodular-bandit,In many machine learning applications; submodular functions have been used as a model for evaluating the utility or payoff of a set such as news items to recommend; sensors to deploy in a terrain; nodes to influence in a social network; to name a few. At the heart of all these applications is the assumption that the underlying utility/payoff function is known a priori; hence maximizing it is in principle possible. In real life situations; however; the utility function is not fully known in advance and can only be estimated via interactions. For instance; whether a user likes a movie or not can be reliably evaluated only after it was shown to her. Or; the range of influence of a user in a social network can be estimated only after she is selected to advertise the product. We model such problems as an interactive submodular bandit optimization; where in each round we receive a context (e.g.; previously selected movies) and have to choose an action (e.g.; propose a new movie). We then receive a noisy feedback about the utility of the action (e.g.; ratings) which we model as a submodular function over the context-action space. We develop SM-UCB that efficiently trades off exploration (collecting more data) and exploration (proposing a good action given gathered data) and achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound after $T$ rounds of interaction. Given a bounded-RKHS norm kernel over the context-action-payoff space that governs the smoothness of the utility function; SM-UCB keeps an upper-confidence bound on the payoff function that allows it to asymptotically achieve no-regret. Finally; we evaluate our results on four concrete applications; including movie recommendation (on the MovieLense data set); news recommendation (on Yahoo! Webscope dataset); interactive influence maximization (on a subset of the Facebook network); and personalized data summarization (on Reuters Corpus). In all these applications; we observe that SM-UCB consistently outperforms the prior art.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6619-interactive-submodular-bandit/bibtex,Lin Chen; Andreas Krause; Amin Karbasi
2017,Dynamic Safe Interruptibility for Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,Poster,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6618-dynamic-safe-interruptibility-for-decentralized-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning.pdf,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6618-dynamic-safe-interruptibility-for-decentralized-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning,In reinforcement learning; agents learn by performing actions and observing their outcomes. Sometimes; it is desirable for a human operator to interrupt an agent in order to prevent dangerous situations from happening. Yet; as part of their learning process; agents may link these interruptions; that impact their reward; to specific states and deliberately avoid them. The situation is particularly challenging in a multi-agent context because agents might not only learn from their own past interruptions; but also from those of other agents. Orseau and Armstrong defined safe interruptibility for one learner; but their work does not naturally extend to multi-agent systems. This paper introduces dynamic safe interruptibility; an alternative definition more suited to decentralized learning problems; and studies this notion in two learning frameworks: joint action learners and independent learners. We give realistic sufficient conditions on the learning algorithm to enable dynamic safe interruptibility in the case of joint action learners; yet show that these conditions are not sufficient for independent learners. We show however that if agents can detect interruptions; it is possible to prune the observations to ensure dynamic safe interruptibility even for independent learners.,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6618-dynamic-safe-interruptibility-for-decentralized-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/bibtex,El Mahdi El Mhamdi; Rachid Guerraoui; Hadrien Hendrikx; Alexandre Maurer
